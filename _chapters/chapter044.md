**Question:** 

I just used the word "orbit", I think, improperly, as a phsyiological term for the place your eyes fit into. I know/think there IS a word for "all that area that kinda surrounds your actual eyeballs; upper cheeks, lower forehead.. the place they fit into". I suppose "socket" also comes to mind, but I would think that refers to the inside bit of where our eyes fit?

Is there a good, common, word for "the face area surrounding the eyes" - one that, specifically, I could use when describing sinus pain?

**Answer:**

The term "orbit" is actually correct for the bony cavity that houses the eye, along with its muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. However, when you want to describe the area surrounding the eyes, especially in terms of sinus pain, "periorbital" is the medical term commonly used. It refers to the area around the eyes, including the eyelids, upper cheeks, and lower forehead, where people often feel pressure or discomfort due to sinus issues.

For more general or conversational descriptions, "eye area" or "around the eyes" is also commonly used, but "periorbital" would be more specific for sinus pain.
