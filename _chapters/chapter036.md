**Question:** 

Children, and autistic people, and, apparently, people with various auto-immune disorders: all of these people are at risk of deciding, for various reasons, that they can’t eat round things or yellow things or meat things or..

What things might doctors refer to this destructured eating as?

**Answer:**

Doctors might refer to this kind of eating as *avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder* (ARFID). ARFID is a relatively new diagnosis, often associated with highly selective or restrictive eating behaviors that go beyond typical "picky eating." This can include strong aversions to certain food colors, shapes, textures, or even categories, like meat. ARFID often develops in childhood, but it can also affect adults, particularly those with sensory processing differences or other neurodivergent traits.

In cases where the aversion is linked specifically to sensory sensitivities (like texture or color) rather than a broader emotional or psychological cause, doctors might also refer to it under the umbrella of *sensory processing disorder* or *sensory food aversion*. This is especially common in autistic individuals, where strong preferences or aversions can be linked to sensory differences.

**Question:**

Is there a broader term for “issues eating food” that all of these would fall under? I am grimy to complete this sentence: “it seems to crazy to me that adults who have had no issues ever can end up gaining _____”. I *could* comfortably put “an eating disorder” or “disordered eating”, but the former is almost exclusively used for anorexia etc and the latter I just made up..

**Answer:**

For a broader term, "disordered eating" actually works well, even though it may sound invented. It’s widely recognized in clinical contexts as an umbrella term for irregular or problematic eating behaviors that don’t necessarily meet the full criteria for a specific eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia. "Disordered eating" can cover a range of behaviors—including food aversions, selective eating, ARFID, and other non-standard eating patterns that can develop suddenly in adults due to stress, sensory sensitivities, health changes, or other factors.

Another option could be "eating challenges" or "eating difficulties," which is even broader and more neutral, encompassing any kind of disruption in regular eating habits without implying a formal diagnosis. So your sentence could be something like:

- "...end up gaining eating difficulties."
- "...end up struggling with disordered eating."

Both choices would convey the concept without the clinical specificity of "an eating disorder."
