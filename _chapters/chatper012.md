**Question:**

I'm gonna take off, but I'll have you leave me with this thought: Please talk to me about, I don't know, "amateur physicists" vs "the entire physics/science complex". It just struck me as amusing that I'm here, talking to you about things that:
A: My 1st grade daughter could not comprehend (so they're a little tricky) but
B: This would be SO foundation to "actual" physicists
C: What's the point of people like me - people who will never become a physist, people who might not even ever run an expirment.. Why am I thinking about these things?!? To this level! And.. Again, per the above.. Like, what even IS "this level"? It's not wrong to say that it's not even like an iceberg in terms of visible vs not, it's more like "not even scratchign the surface", no? Hmm. Let's chart that out, in ascending knowledge.. 1. People who never think about physics even a little, though they know if you throw a ball up it will come back down 2. People who barely even think about phsyics but they did actually learn about it in school and remember that it's Newton's fault that the ball comes back down. 3. People who do want to think about physics and it's not enough that _Newton said_ it will come back down, we need to know WHY and HOW, but still, we're ages away from 4. Actual physisicts. people who are paid to think abotu it. 

**Answer:**

Your question beautifully encapsulates what it means to engage with knowledge as an amateur, a seeker, or a curious mind—and the value of doing so. Let's unpack it step by step.

### The Spectrum of Physics Engagement (Charting It Out)

1. **Everyday Intuition (The Ball Comes Back Down):**
   - This is where most people live. They understand basic cause-and-effect relationships like gravity because they see them in action. No equations, no theories—just observation and instinct. 
   - Example: "I drop my phone, it falls. Gravity is real." 

2. **School-Level Understanding (Newton’s Fault):**
   - People at this level know there’s more to the story. They’ve heard of Newton’s laws, might vaguely remember “F = ma,” and understand that gravity isn’t just magic—it’s a force with some underlying rules.
   - Example: "Gravity pulls objects down at 9.8 m/s², thanks to Earth’s mass. Newton figured this out centuries ago."

3. **The Curious Mind (Why and How?):**
   - This is where you’re hanging out: asking questions that go beyond "what happens" to "why does it happen this way?" and "could it happen differently?"
   - Example: "What exactly is gravity? How do forces and masses interact at a deeper level? What would happen if the universe had different physical laws?"
   - You don’t need to be a professional physicist to engage meaningfully here—you just need curiosity and the willingness to follow the thread.

4. **The Professional Physicist (The Paid Thinker):**
   - These are the experts who have spent years studying, running experiments, writing papers, and contributing to humanity’s collective understanding of the universe.
   - Example: "How does general relativity describe gravity in terms of spacetime curvature? How does quantum mechanics fit into this framework—or not?"

5. **The Theoretical Visionary (Shaping the Unknown):**
   - This is the rarefied air of people like Einstein or Hawking, who don’t just understand the rules but rewrite or redefine them for everyone else. They bridge gaps between established knowledge and uncharted territory.
   - Example: "What’s beyond the Standard Model? Can we unify quantum mechanics and general relativity?"

### Why Think About These Things at All?

You’re asking, "What’s the point of me thinking about physics when I’m not a physicist?" Here’s why it’s valuable:

1. **The Joy of Wonder:**
   - Humans are naturally curious. Engaging with big ideas—even at a foundational level—reminds us how astonishing the universe is. It’s deeply satisfying to explore how things work, even if we don’t reach the “end” of the explanation.

2. **A Shared Continuum of Knowledge:**
   - Amateur physicists and curious learners play a role in the ecosystem of science. They spread ideas, ask fresh questions, and often challenge professionals to explain complex concepts in ways that make sense to non-experts.
   - Example: Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson didn’t just talk to other scientists—they spoke to *everyone*. This dialogue inspires new generations of thinkers.

3. **Perspective:**
   - Learning about physics expands your sense of scale and place in the universe. Thinking about iron lakes, molten planets, or helium oceans helps connect the dots between the everyday and the cosmic.

4. **A Gateway to Deeper Engagement:**
   - For some, curiosity grows into action. Today’s musings about melting points could lead to experimenting with home physics kits, joining science discussions, or even contributing to science education.

### How Much Are You *Really* Scratching the Surface?

It’s true that what you’re exploring is foundational for physicists—but it’s not meaningless! Scratching the surface matters because:
- Every physicist started somewhere. Newton himself didn’t emerge fully formed; he started with curiosity about apples and motion.
- Understanding foundational concepts provides a scaffold for more advanced ideas. You might not end up calculating quantum states, but your questions could open pathways for others—or simply make your world richer.

### Amateurs vs. The Science Complex: What’s the Relationship?

Here’s the balance:
1. **Amateurs:** Bring fresh eyes, creativity, and enthusiasm. They remind the "complex" that science is for everyone, not just the experts.
2. **Professionals:** Push the boundaries of knowledge systematically and rigorously. They rely on amateurs to sustain public interest and funding and to inspire the next generation.

Both roles are essential. Without amateurs, science risks becoming an ivory tower. Without professionals, amateurs would lack the tools and discoveries to fuel their wonder.

### Final Thought: What Level Are You At?

Your current level of engagement—exploring why things work the way they do and wondering what might be possible—is powerful. You’re part of the conversation about knowledge, and that’s not "barely scratching the surface." It’s the foundation of how humans collectively learn and grow.

Even the "entire physics/science complex" wouldn’t exist without the curiosity of people like you, constantly asking, "But why?"
