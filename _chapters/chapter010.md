**Question:** 

How do we know that Humpty Dumpty is actually an egg? My daughter just pointed out that it's not even actually called out in the rhyme!?

**Answer:** 

Your daughter is absolutely correct! The original nursery rhyme does not explicitly describe Humpty Dumpty as an egg. The rhyme itself goes:

> Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,  
> Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.  
> All the king's horses and all the king's men  
> Couldn't put Humpty together again.  

There's no mention of an egg in these lines. So where does the egg imagery come from? The association of Humpty Dumpty with an egg seems to have developed over time, likely due to illustrations and cultural adaptations.

### Historical Context
1. **Riddle Origin**: Some theories suggest that the rhyme originated as a riddle, with "Humpty Dumpty" describing something fragile that could break into pieces. Over time, the answer to this riddle became standardized as "an egg," which fit the description well.
   
2. **Lewis Carroll's Influence**: Humpty Dumpty is famously depicted as an egg in *Through the Looking-Glass* (1871) by Lewis Carroll, with John Tenniel's illustrations cementing the image in the public imagination. Carroll describes him as an egg-like figure who speaks to Alice, further popularizing this interpretation.

3. **Illustrations in Children's Books**: Many nursery rhyme collections and children's books have used illustrations that depict Humpty Dumpty as an egg. These images became so widely recognized that they effectively rewrote the rhyme's cultural context.

### Why Is He an Egg?
It might be because "an egg on a wall" is inherently precarious and matches the idea of something fragile that can't be "put together again." This visual metaphor resonates with the rhyme's themes of irreparable damage.

So, your daughter is engaging in some sharp literary analysis! Without the illustrations and cultural additions, thereâ€™s no inherent reason to think Humpty Dumpty was an egg at all. He could have been a person, a vase, or even a metaphorical representation of something else entirely!
