**Question:** 

How many years since 1975 have the president, senate, and house, all been the same party in USA?

**Answer:**

Since 1975, the United States has seen the president, the Senate, and the House all under the same party’s control for the following years:

1. **1977–1980**: Democratic president (Jimmy Carter) with a Democratic-controlled Congress (Senate and House).
2. **1993–1994**: Democratic president (Bill Clinton) with a Democratic-controlled Congress.
3. **2001**: Republican president (George W. Bush) with a Republican-controlled Congress, but this was disrupted in June when Senator Jim Jeffords switched parties, giving control of the Senate to the Democrats.
4. **2003–2006**: Republican president (George W. Bush) with a Republican-controlled Congress.
5. **2009–2010**: Democratic president (Barack Obama) with a Democratic-controlled Congress.
6. **2017–2018**: Republican president (Donald Trump) with a Republican-controlled Congress.

Summing these periods, we get:

- **1977–1980**: 4 years
- **1993–1994**: 2 years
- **2001**: Less than a year (partial, 5 months)
- **2003–2006**: 4 years
- **2009–2010**: 2 years
- **2017–2018**: 2 years

Totaling these up, we get **approximately 14 years** where all three were aligned under the same party since 1975.
