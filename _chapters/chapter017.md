**Question:** 

Do you have any idea at all why conspiracy theorists and snake oil purchasers seem to like numbers? You and I just spoke in another thread about how "Healing properties of 432 mhz!" are likely just entirely bogus. From how you described it to me, it honestly sounded like someone somewhere saw a number that had anything to do with a nature and decided..

Anyway, conspiracy theorists seem to do the same thing, at least when we're making fun of them: "see? the numbers in their birthday, when you reverse them and add them up total up to the number of the beast, so OBVIOUSLY _____!".

Anyway. It feels weird to take this... Numbers are *kinda* an arbitrary human abstraction. Nature doesn't know or care about numbers (for physics anyway. I can't deny that there are TWO TREES, those numbers definitely exist. But circular things in nature could care less about PI, and light has no idea of what speed it's traveling at..) . So it feels weird that we'd make up this thing called numbers and THEN make up even more on top of it! And yet, we've presumably been doing it for a long time?

So, as per initial paragraph: Please talk to me about why humans keep convincing themselves that numbers have some special meaning, and, moreso, that somehow it transcends.. Even if you somehow agree "the number 9 is magic!" getting from THERE to "and it makes my gi tract balance!" is just such a huge stretch.. (And yet some people keep doing it?)

**Answer:**

You're asking about something that ties into a fascinating intersection of psychology, culture, and the way humans relate to abstract concepts. The tendency to attribute special, even mystical, significance to numbers—especially when they show up in ways that seem meaningful, like patterns or coincidences—is deeply rooted in how our minds are wired. Here's a deeper look at some reasons why this happens:

### 1. **Pattern Recognition and Cognitive Biases**
Humans are incredibly good at spotting patterns, even where there are none. This skill helped our ancestors survive and adapt by recognizing things like dangerous animals, changing seasons, and social dynamics. Unfortunately, this natural tendency can also lead us to see significance in random events. It's called **pareidolia**, the phenomenon where we recognize familiar shapes or patterns—like faces in clouds or numbers in random data—because our brains are hardwired to look for meaning, even when there isn't any.

This pattern-seeking behavior is crucial in understanding why conspiracy theorists, for example, might fixate on numbers. If a certain sequence of numbers (say, someone's birthday or the number 666) appears multiple times, the brain leaps to the conclusion that there’s something special about it, often ignoring any alternate explanations or the possibility that it's random.

### 2. **Numerology and Cultural Significance**
Numbers have been imbued with meaning for millennia, and this is deeply entrenched in many cultural traditions. **Numerology**, for example, is an ancient belief system that assigns mystical properties to numbers. For instance, the number 7 is considered lucky, and certain combinations of numbers are seen as auspicious or inauspicious in various cultures. This tradition extends to sacred texts like the Bible, where numbers are given symbolic meaning, influencing many people's worldviews.

Once you have a long history of seeing numbers as meaningful (whether in religious or spiritual contexts), it becomes easy for people to continue interpreting numbers as signs or omens. Conspiracy theorists often draw on this, making connections between numbers and world events (like associating someone's birthdate with "the number of the beast") to lend credibility to their theories. 

### 3. **The Power of Arbitrary Abstraction**
Numbers themselves are abstractions—they don’t inherently carry any special meaning in the natural world. Yet, we give them meaning because they allow us to represent and quantify things in a concrete way. When someone says “432 Hz” or “the number 9,” they are abstracting a concept into a form that feels more understandable, even if it’s meaningless or only superficially connected to reality. Numbers offer a kind of **cognitive shortcut** that can make things seem more *rational* or *scientific*, even when they’re not.

This abstraction process can be taken to extremes, and it's not limited to pseudoscience or conspiracy theories. Mathematics is built on abstractions that, while extremely powerful in explaining the universe, don’t directly reflect how nature operates. For example, **pi** is a human construct that helps us calculate properties of circles, but nature itself doesn’t “care” about pi—it just *is*. Still, our minds love giving these abstractions more than their due weight, which is why things like "432 Hz" get elevated to the realm of special importance: it’s *abstractive*, and the very fact that it can be measured gives it an air of scientific legitimacy, even if it’s ultimately a stretch.

### 4. **Meaning-Making and Control**
A big driver behind humans attributing special meanings to numbers is the deep psychological need for meaning and control. When people feel anxious, uncertain, or out of control, they often turn to symbols, rituals, or patterns to help restore a sense of order. Conspiracy theorists often find comfort in the idea that they’ve uncovered hidden knowledge or that some cosmic force is behind a specific number. This gives them a sense of understanding, even in a chaotic world.

If you can interpret numbers (like adding up someone's birthday or finding correlations between events) and tie them to a larger narrative, it can give you the illusion of control over otherwise uncontrollable things—like the randomness of life or the unpredictability of politics. It’s a way of saying, “I can make sense of this; I’m not powerless.”

### 5. **The Appeal of Magical Thinking**
Finally, there’s **magical thinking**—the belief that one's thoughts, words, or actions can influence the world in ways that defy natural laws. Numbers fit neatly into this type of thinking because they are universally understood and quantifiable. When you take something abstract like numbers and connect them to real-world outcomes (like “balancing my GI tract with the number 9”), you are linking two realms of experience: the mystical and the practical.

Even though the connection between "9" and "gut health" seems nonsensical, the human mind often finds comfort in these types of associations, especially when they are framed as an ancient, hidden wisdom. This is especially true in cultures or subcultures that value the unexplained or the unscientific.

### In Summary:
Humans are pattern-seeking creatures, and when it comes to numbers, this tendency is amplified by both cultural practices (like numerology) and cognitive biases (like pareidolia). We find meaning in numbers because it helps us navigate uncertainty and feel in control. When someone attaches mystical or conspiratorial significance to numbers—such as connecting a birthday to "the number of the beast"—it taps into deep-seated psychological needs for meaning, control, and certainty in an uncertain world. Despite the arbitrary nature of numbers, the human mind insists on finding meaning in them because it offers comfort, a sense of order, and the illusion of understanding.
