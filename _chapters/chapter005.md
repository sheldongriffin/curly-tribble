**Question:** My son, a child entering high school in the 2020s, has taken an interest in some music from MY high school days, in the 1990s. All the bands that he is pulled towards are _generally speaking* under the high umbrella of “alternative”, but within that they span from punk-pop to ska to industrial to.. Not all the same genre, anyway.

However, the weird part is, they’re also all.. the word that comes to mind is “cheesy”. I’m trying to break that down and it may be as simple as “the critics didn’t like them”. But I do think there is more to it. (I even went so far as to philosophize that, perhaps, nerdy white music critics just kinda hate *fun*).

Anyway, some examples:
Ween
They Might Be Giants
Butthole Surfers
Sublime
Limp Bizkit
Weezer
Primus

1. IS there some kind, any kind, of similarity here? They’re all different genres and yet they feel similar.
2. How does one *accidentally* end up liking a… “sub-genre”? “cross-genre”? “classification”? Don’t know what to call it. But I tend to go deep into specific genres; he somehow skims them and picks ones that.. 🤷
3. Most importantly, perhaps, how do I walk back using the word “cheesy” to describe my son’s burgeoning musical tastes? I need both a framework in which they aren’t actually “cheesy” AND some kind of alternative quick adjective so that we can continue to easily refer to this.. “genre”

**Answer:** 1. **Common Threads**: These bands share a playful, irreverent approach to music, often blending humor, absurdity, or irony with their sound. Many also incorporate experimental or genre-blurring elements while remaining accessible, which might appeal to someone seeking novelty or quirkiness. Additionally, several were commercially successful yet critically divisive, making them feel both countercultural and mainstream.

2. **Accidental Sub-Genre Liking**: Your son might be drawn to the energy, humor, or distinctiveness of these bands rather than a specific genre. It’s possible that his preferences are guided by mood or the thematic vibe of the music rather than strict genre loyalty. Cross-genre appeal happens naturally when the "spirit" of the music aligns across diverse sounds.

3. **Reframing from "Cheesy"**: Instead of “cheesy,” you might frame these bands as **eccentric**, **playful**, or **quirky**. A broader category like “offbeat alternative” or even “fun-forward alt” could capture the essence without negative connotations. Celebrate the creativity and boundary-pushing nature of this music—it’s more about personality than polish. 

If you’re discussing it with your son, focusing on terms like “experimental” or “genre-defying” might resonate better, highlighting the cool factor of breaking musical norms rather than any implied tackiness.
