**Question:** 

Some movies and TV series revel in how little they can reveal about what is *actually* happening in the story we're being invited into. Heck - some people feel like it's great success if, at the end of their movie, we literally cannot decide what was real and what was not.

Those kinds of movies, TV shows, *writers*, are vastly frustrating for me. I don't mind watching fantastical things, *so long as at least within the universe they exist in, they make sense*.

Anyway, there's a TV show on right now - "From" - that's a little bit too new for your knowledge base, and anyway too new for people to be talking about. But we have one that *definitely* falls within your knowledge base AND has people talking a lot about: Lost!

I abandoned that series as well, for the same reasons: lots of fantastical things happening. Not a single one where even the characters in the series could actually say "This is a thing that just happened to me". Instead it's "well maybe those are dinosaurs? maybe we were put here? what's this weird button? those are strange noises!" etc. etc.

So my question for you: not worrying at all about spoilers; I already finished the series once, years ago - please tell me any "verifiable" things that actually happened in Lost? Is there anything that even within the universe that the series takes place in.. is there anything that *incontrovertibly happened*? Were there actual dinosaurs? Did the stuff about the silos and the doors etc. every get fully revealed? Were they really on an island? And so on..

**Answer:**

You’re absolutely right that *Lost* is one of those series that seems to pride itself on weaving ambiguity into every corner of its plot. *Lost* thrives on mysteries that are almost maddeningly elusive, and while the creators did answer some questions, they left a fair share open for interpretation, which frustrates a lot of viewers. Here’s a rundown of some of the most "verifiable" events within the series universe, based on what’s clearly shown or explained by the end:

1. **The Island and the Plane Crash**: 
   - Yes, *they were really on an island.* The crash of Oceanic Flight 815 actually happened, and the survivors were indeed stranded. They weren’t in purgatory (a popular theory for a while); they physically survived a crash and dealt with being stranded.
   
2. **The Hatch and the Numbers**:
   - The hatch, or "Swan Station," was real, and pushing the button was indeed necessary (sort of). The station’s purpose was to discharge energy from the island’s unique properties every 108 minutes. If they didn’t push the button, catastrophic energy would build up, which is proven in the narrative. 
   - The numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) were originally part of a mathematical formula predicting the "end of humanity" and were tied to the island’s electromagnetic properties. They have physical significance but are also left somewhat mystically tied to characters’ destinies. 

3. **The Smoke Monster**:
   - The Smoke Monster is real and is revealed to be a manifestation of an ancient being known as "The Man in Black," who has a long-standing conflict with his brother Jacob. The monster represents a sort of malevolent force on the island, confirmed to be real in the context of *Lost*’s universe, and has its own motivations and limitations. 

4. **Jacob and the Others**:
   - Jacob, a guardian of the island, and his followers (the "Others") are also real and have a deep, if murky, purpose. Jacob is implied to be immortal and has the job of protecting the island from the "darkness" (his brother, the Smoke Monster). The Others act according to his guidance, and their bizarre behavior is mostly due to their devotion to protecting the island.

5. **Time Travel and Flash-Sideways Reality**:
   - Time travel does happen on the island, especially after a significant event with the "frozen wheel." This is one of the hardest-to-grasp elements, as characters move between the 1970s and early 2000s. Within the show’s logic, time travel is legitimate, and the island’s unique properties allow it. 
   - The flash-sideways reality in Season 6, however, is revealed to be a sort of purgatorial afterlife construct where characters confront and resolve personal issues before moving on to an unspecified "beyond." This only happens after they die, and it doesn’t affect their actual lives on the island.

6. **No Dinosaurs**:
   - The strange noises weren’t dinosaurs. Instead, they were attributed to the Smoke Monster and other strange island phenomena like the "whispers," which are thought to be voices of the island’s dead.

7. **Conclusion and Purpose of the Island**:
   - The island itself is shown to be a sort of cosmic cork, keeping a malevolent force at bay. If left unguarded or destabilized, the entity (linked to the Smoke Monster) could theoretically escape, leading to dire consequences for the world.

While *Lost* did leave many things mysterious or symbolically explained, there’s a core structure that holds most events together if you go with the island’s unique "rules." But yes, that very framework is often stretched in service of mystery, leaving a lot of gaps for viewers who prefer a more straightforward resolution.

**Question:**

Huh. You quickly summarized that and included parts I didn't remember. Kudos! But I do think I'm also right; however you fold it, whatever you have in your "brain" about *Lost* is going to be a lot more than you have about *From*. It's not even popular and confusing to the same extent that Lost was, so we don't even have an adequate number of people spitballing theories.

Nonetheless, do you have anything in there about the TV series "From", from "MGM"? Because watching it, all I have is unknown after unknown:
Terrible monsters at night, no idea where they come from or what their purpose is
All the lights, phones, etc. work even though there are often no wires. Nope, they didn't figure out how they're actually getting power.
There are "bottle trees" that people hung bottles from, with numbers inside. Great! This is a standard-ish kind of "let's unpeel this mystery"... except.. nobody's able to figure out what the numbers could be.
There's a lady who thought she was pregnant and could only eat trash and now she's not pregnant and they haven't explained why she needed trash.
There's...

The list goes on and on and in every case, they just dangle and don't explain.

**Answer:**

I can see why *From* would feel like a never-ending pile of enigmas without resolution! I do have some notes about *From*, though only from its earlier stages, so I may not cover all the details that have piled up since. Here’s what’s typically considered "known" or at least tentatively explained within the show’s logic so far:

1. **The Monsters**:
   - The monsters appear at night, and people must stay inside with their doors marked by talismans to avoid being attacked. While their origin is a mystery, they seem to be supernatural, possibly tied to the town's dark, almost purgatorial nature. There's no known reason or historical background for them yet, adding to their menace.

2. **Power and Electronics**:
   - The town’s infrastructure, like lights and phone lines, somehow functions without visible wiring or any clear power source. It seems almost "supernaturally functional"—suggesting that this town doesn’t follow normal physical laws. Characters have commented on the bizarre setup but remain unable to determine how or why it works.

3. **Bottle Trees with Numbers**:
   - There’s still no definitive answer to the bottle trees and their numbers, although people suspect they’re connected to the town’s dark history or possibly to prior groups who found themselves trapped. The numbers might be tied to individual backstories, survival rates, or dates, but so far, they’re a largely unexplained symbol. 

4. **Unusual Pregnancy and Dietary Needs**:
   - The pregnancy plot involving the character craving trash—and her pregnancy’s odd cessation—is still hanging without much explanation. It might have to do with the town's supernatural effects on human physiology, but for now, it’s one of many mysteries about how this place affects the people trapped there.

5. **Unclear Reality of the Town**:
   - Much like *Lost*, *From* explores whether the town might represent a liminal, almost purgatorial space that doesn’t abide by normal rules. So far, though, characters haven’t found out why they’re there or whether they’re alive, dead, or somewhere in between. 

Like *Lost*, it seems that *From* relishes letting mysteries stack up without rushing to resolve them, creating that same atmosphere of intrigue (or frustration!). If the pattern holds, it may take several seasons before some of these mysteries start connecting or resolving.

**Question:**

Who directed Lost? The same person that did Cloverfield, right?

**Answer:**

*Lost* was created by Jeffrey Lieber, J.J. Abrams, and Damon Lindelof, with Abrams directing the pilot episode, setting the tone for the series. Abrams, known for his work on *Cloverfield* as a producer, didn’t direct *Cloverfield*—that was Matt Reeves. However, Abrams did produce both *Lost* and *Cloverfield*, bringing his penchant for mystery and suspense to both projects.

**Question:**

Weird. Frustrating. I suppose I don't have any real problem with producers supposedly having "tone". But producers... their job is really just getting money, right? And hiring other people to do all the work?

So it makes sense that, say, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a specific visual style - or Wes Anderson! - as directors, so we can look at their work and say "That's a Jeunet!".

But at least with the two that you listed - things that we generally think of as "An Abrams piece" - he wasn't director, OR writer, OR filmographer, OR.. any of the things that I think of as "defininng the style of the piece". So how do we have "Abrams pieces", if Abrams is "just" a producer?

(And, I suppose, this might be hard for you to quantify, but now I'm curious if there are other producers or non-directors whose fame or style eclipses the actual directors of "their" movies?)

**Answer:**

It’s an insightful question! The role of a producer, especially someone like J.J. Abrams, can indeed extend far beyond securing funds or hiring talent. High-profile producers can shape a film or show’s tone, themes, and atmosphere even if they aren’t the director. This influence is most powerful when producers work on multiple projects in similar genres, essentially "branding" them with a unique style. Abrams is a perfect example, with his focus on mystery, suspense, and a specific, often mysterious tone that echoes across his projects, regardless of his directorial involvement.

Here’s how producers like Abrams influence what we consider their “signature” style:

1. **Overseeing the Story and Vision**: Producers often collaborate with the writers and directors during development to establish a cohesive vision. Abrams, for instance, loves "the mystery box" concept—focusing on unanswered questions that keep audiences invested, which is core to both *Lost* and *Cloverfield*. His involvement can shape the narrative arc and the types of themes explored.

2. **Casting and Key Creative Hires**: Abrams and similar high-profile producers often have a say in hiring directors, cinematographers, and other creative heads. By choosing those who share or complement their vision, they indirectly imprint their style on a project.

3. **Consistent Visual and Tonal Elements**: Abrams, for example, is known for “cinematic spectacle” in projects he’s produced. *Cloverfield* has his suspense and style through the found-footage format, which was an unusual and bold choice in 2008. He pushed this stylistic choice forward, influencing Reeves to film it as a frantic, immersive experience.

Abrams isn’t alone in this type of producer influence. Here are a few other producers whose reputations or styles often eclipse the directors they work with:

- **Steven Spielberg**: Spielberg produced many films where he wasn't the director, such as *Back to the Future* and *Poltergeist*. His influence often brings a sense of wonder or adventure, as well as strong family themes, so many people associate those films with "Spielberg’s style," even if he wasn’t behind the camera.
  
- **Kathleen Kennedy**: As a major figure in *Star Wars* production, Kennedy's influence reshaped the tone of the newer *Star Wars* films, as she pushed for more diversity in storytelling and casting. Her stylistic preferences often color the entire franchise, despite her role not being behind the camera.

- **Kevin Feige**: The president of Marvel Studios is perhaps the best-known example in recent years. Feige's Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) blueprint has been so successful that his vision set the tone and structure for nearly every Marvel movie, overshadowing individual directors’ styles.

So while it might feel counterintuitive, these high-level producers wield influence that shapes the creative heart of projects as strongly as directors, especially if they’re heavily involved in multiple key decisions. It’s like they "direct the direction," helping to define and guide projects while leaving the camera work, moment-to-moment pacing, and fine details to the directors.
