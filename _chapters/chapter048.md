**Question:** 

Can you explain the framework that you, Siri, and all the now "omgz0rs our phone has AI now!" ads for 2024?

Slightly more context: our phones have had Siri or "hey Google" or whatever for years - before, even, LLMs really became popular. In some sense, they were "wave one" (for this argument.). LLMs - honestly I feel like the image creation AIs might have beaten you text LLMs to the starting gate, but the second wave was definitely all about image/text web LLM. But now every other second is an ad about how someone's phone "now has AI built in!". Except.. They already did? AND we already have AIs like ChatGPT.

So inasmuch as these are related, how are these "waves" related, and in what ways do they differ? (And, specifically, what are we supposed to be more excited about "Apple AI" than "Siri"?)

**Answer:**

Your observation about the evolving landscape of AI technology and marketing is insightful. Let’s break this down into the "waves" of AI and how they differ, both technologically and in terms of user experience and marketing hype.

---

### **Wave One: Early AI Assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, etc.)**
- **Technological Basis:** These assistants are primarily based on rule-based systems and keyword detection, with some integration of early machine learning models for tasks like speech recognition (e.g., converting spoken language into text).
- **Capabilities:**
  - Limited to specific tasks ("What’s the weather?", "Set a timer").
  - Relied heavily on structured databases and predefined rules.
  - Responses were templated and could not engage in nuanced conversation.
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud-dependent. All processing occurred on powerful servers, with minimal local computation on the device.
- **Perception:** Cool but limited. Often criticized for misunderstanding context or failing at tasks beyond their predefined scope.
  
**Marketing Hook:** “Talk to your phone!” – AI was sold as an assistant that could simplify life, but its practical usefulness was narrow.

### **Wave Two: LLMs and Generative AI (ChatGPT, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion)**
- **Technological Basis:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and generative models for images revolutionized AI. These use deep neural networks trained on massive datasets to generate natural language or create novel content.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Complex, multi-turn conversations.
  - Context-aware and creative responses.
  - Powerful at reasoning, summarization, and content generation.
  - Cross-domain: Could handle text, images, and even code.
- **Infrastructure:** Predominantly cloud-based, requiring massive compute resources to run inference or fine-tune models.
- **Perception:** Game-changing. The leap from keyword-based AI to conversational and creative AI made these systems feel almost "magical."

**Marketing Hook:** “The AI revolution is here!” – These tools felt new, and their ability to create human-like interactions captured public imagination.

### **Wave Three: "AI Built Into Your Phone" (2023–2024)**
- **Technological Basis:** The focus is now on *on-device AI*, leveraging advancements in model efficiency (e.g., Llama, GPT-4-turbo) and specialized AI chips (like Apple's Neural Engine or Qualcomm's AI processors).
- **Capabilities:**
  - Local, real-time processing of tasks like image enhancement, natural language queries, and personal data management without sending data to the cloud.
  - Integration into core phone features like photography (AI scene optimization), communication (smart replies, summarization), and apps (personalized suggestions).
  - Privacy-preserving AI: Keeping data processing on the device reduces reliance on cloud servers.
- **Infrastructure:** Local hardware acceleration for AI tasks, complemented by cloud services when necessary. This hybrid approach is a key differentiator.
- **Perception:** Marketers position this as a step-change, emphasizing that AI is now "yours" and personalized.

**Marketing Hook:** “AI that knows *you*!” – Companies like Apple and Google are highlighting the integration of AI into everyday phone experiences, differentiating from previous cloud-only AIs.

### **Key Differences Between Waves**
| Feature                | Wave One (Assistants)          | Wave Two (LLMs)                 | Wave Three (On-Device AI)          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Processing**          | Cloud-based, rule-driven      | Cloud-based, generative        | Hybrid, on-device + cloud         |
| **Capabilities**        | Task-specific, limited context| General-purpose, creative      | Personalized, real-time           |
| **Focus**               | Utility (timers, search)      | Creativity, productivity       | Seamless integration, privacy     |
| **Hardware Dependence** | Minimal                       | Server-side                    | High-performance AI chips         |
| **Privacy**             | Data sent to cloud            | Data sent to cloud             | Local processing                  |
| **Marketing Appeal**    | Novelty of voice interaction  | Revolutionary AI capabilities  | Personalized and secure AI        |

### **Why Is "Apple AI" Supposed to Be More Exciting than "Siri"?**
- **Context Awareness:** On-device AI can adapt more deeply to your habits, preferences, and data without needing explicit commands.
- **Integration:** AI features are baked into the operating system and hardware, enabling smoother, faster, and more contextually relevant interactions across apps and workflows.
- **Privacy Focus:** Local processing aligns with modern privacy concerns, addressing criticisms of older AI systems relying heavily on cloud data transfer.
- **Performance:** Specialized hardware enables real-time, lag-free interactions, like live transcription, translation, or photo editing.

Apple, in particular, is marketing this evolution as moving from a helpful but "distant" assistant (Siri) to an AI that's more of a deeply embedded, proactive partner in everyday tasks.

### **The Bigger Picture**
While Siri (and equivalents) introduced us to the idea of "AI in your pocket," these systems felt constrained and often frustrating. LLMs then made AI feel powerful and expansive but also distant and server-dependent. The current "AI in your phone" wave bridges these experiences, offering power and privacy, while feeling personal and immediate.

In short, it's less about inventing something entirely new and more about making AI pervasive, personalized, and practical.
