*Editor's note: The video that brought on this question is [Ringo Sheena's "迷彩"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrKu4ASKqTE), and it's glorious madness.*

**Question:** 

Please list some female japanese singers who:
1. Have at times been very famous in Japan (not lately, I think)
2. *Could have* been called "The Queen of Japanese ___", though a: I don't know what genre to put there, and b: i don't know for sure anyone has ever called her that
3. Are "pop" music, more or less, but they're also famous for, specifically, "experimental" pop
4. I swear her name always reminds me of Ringo Star? Though that could be cheating and narrow it down to a single artist. If so, do include that artist, but I'm still interested in other guesses.

TLDR: Japanese, female, pop music *with at least one album of experimental pop*

**Answer:**

Based on your description, there's one artist who stands out immediately: **Ringo Sheena** (also known as Shiina Ringo). She’s often considered an icon in Japanese music for her experimental approach within the pop and rock genres, and her name is a close match to your Ringo Starr clue! Here’s a list of similar artists who might also fit your description, including Ringo Sheena:

1. **Ringo Sheena** (椎名林檎)  
   - Known as one of Japan's most distinctive pop stars with a flair for experimental and eclectic sounds, combining pop, rock, jazz, and electronic influences. She was hugely popular in the late 1990s and 2000s, and her work is still influential today.

2. **Yuki** (ユキ, from the band Judy and Mary)  
   - Yuki rose to fame as the lead singer of Judy and Mary, a band known for its unique mix of punk, pop, and alternative rock. Her solo career continued to experiment with genres, blending pop with indie and electronica.

3. **Tujiko Noriko**  
   - Known for her more experimental and electronic approach to pop music, Tujiko Noriko's work leans heavily into avant-garde and ambient styles. She might not have been as mainstream famous but has a dedicated following and a unique style.

4. **Akiko Yano** (矢野顕子)  
   - A pioneer in experimental pop and jazz fusion in Japan, Akiko Yano has a long career spanning back to the 1970s. Known for her collaborations with Ryuichi Sakamoto and her innovative piano work, she brought experimental elements into her music, which remains influential in Japanese pop.

5. **Chara** (チャラ)  
   - Known for her dreamy, breathy vocal style and ethereal music, Chara has been active since the early 1990s. Her work spans pop, rock, and experimental sounds, and she remains a unique figure in Japanese pop music.

6. **Jun Togawa** (戸川純)  
   - Often described as an avant-garde pop artist, Jun Togawa blends pop music with unconventional and surreal elements. Known for pushing boundaries, her music is highly experimental and sometimes jarring, yet she has had a significant influence on the Japanese pop and punk scenes.

Each of these artists has left a distinct mark on Japanese pop and “experimental” music, but **Ringo Sheena** is most likely the one you’re thinking of, given the "Ringo" clue. Let me know if any of these artists sound familiar, or if you’d like more suggestions!

**Question:**

What would be five or so American/English speaking artists that might meet those criteria? Female + pop + experimental + sometimes famous + English/American instead of Japanese?

**Answer:**

Here are five English-speaking female artists from the American/Western pop music scene who align well with your criteria of pop music with experimental tendencies, and who have been famous (at least at times) in their careers:

1. **Kate Bush**  
   - Widely considered one of the most innovative and experimental pop artists of her time, Kate Bush rose to fame in the late 1970s and 1980s with hits like *Wuthering Heights* and *Running Up That Hill*. Known for her distinctive voice, theatricality, and genre-blending style, she is often referred to as a “Queen” of art-pop or experimental pop.

2. **Björk**  
   - From Iceland but with a global fanbase, Björk is known for her groundbreaking work in pop, electronica, and avant-garde music. Famous for her unique, often experimental sound and visual style, she’s one of the best examples of a mainstream artist who constantly pushes boundaries and redefines pop music.

3. **Tori Amos**  
   - Tori Amos gained fame in the 1990s with her emotional, piano-driven music and genre-blending style that fuses rock, pop, and alternative. Her work often delves into experimental structures and themes, and she is known for her distinctive, often haunting voice.

4. **FKA twigs**  
   - A more recent addition to the scene, FKA twigs is known for her highly experimental approach to pop and R&B. She combines futuristic beats, ethereal vocals, and haunting visuals, creating a unique blend of pop and avant-garde.

5. **Laurie Anderson**  
   - While not strictly “pop,” Laurie Anderson gained mainstream attention with her experimental art-pop and spoken-word music, particularly with her song *O Superman*, which reached the UK charts in the early 1980s. Her work is known for its innovative use of electronic sounds, and she’s often considered a pioneering figure in experimental music.

These artists all bring a unique, genre-bending approach to pop, combining elements of experimental or avant-garde music with mainstream appeal. Kate Bush, Björk, and Tori Amos, in particular, might align well with the level of mainstream success and experimentation you’re looking for.

**Question:**

I expect, though, given whatever metrics you'd like to use, out of all the poeple we've listed, Bjork is really "The English (Finnish?) Shiina Ringo", no? She's all over the place. And totally experimental. And has had really high charting simple pop songs and really difficult impossible to grok experimental songs. I'm biased in her favor, but I can't really think of anyone who has been both as big as she sometimes is AND as experimental AND .. I mean, there are tons and tons of expiermental artists *I have never heard of*. It's hard to be truly experimental AND rise to he level where everyone knows you..

**Answer:**

You're absolutely right! Björk is perhaps one of the clearest analogs to Shiina Ringo in the English-speaking world. Like Ringo, Björk has consistently pushed the boundaries of pop music with her experimental sound, embracing a wide range of genres—from electronic and avant-garde to classical and jazz—while still maintaining a distinct identity. She has mastered the balance of creating music that can be both widely accessible and incredibly complex, just as Ringo has done with her own works.

Björk’s career is full of moments where her music has been recognized both for its experimental nature and for its pop accessibility. Albums like *Homogenic* (1997) and *Vespertine* (2001) blend orchestral, electronic, and experimental elements into emotionally resonant pop music. On the other hand, albums like *Medúlla* (2004), which features only human voices and minimalist instrumentation, showcase her more avant-garde tendencies. She's consistently been able to generate mainstream recognition with songs like "Hyperballad" and "It’s Oh So Quiet," yet has also dived deep into experimental waters that few mainstream artists dare to explore.

Björk's ability to combine the accessible with the experimental has made her a global figure, respected not just in pop but across artistic communities. It's a very similar path to Shiina Ringo's in that regard—both artists have had successful mainstream careers while consistently delivering art that challenges listeners.

As you mentioned, it's hard to achieve true experimental success while also being a household name. Björk has done that over decades, maintaining both high charting success and critical acclaim while keeping her experimental edge.

In summary, Björk might indeed be *the* parallel to Shiina Ringo in the English-speaking world, based on the mix of experimental risk-taking, pop accessibility, and global recognition. Few artists have managed to walk this line with the same level of consistency and innovation.

For more on Björk's musical evolution and her reputation as an experimental pop artist, sources like NPR's *All Songs Considered* or articles from *Pitchfork* and *Rolling Stone* offer deep dives into her catalog.
