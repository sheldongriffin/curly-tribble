**Question:** 

Help me walk back this panic a little bit:

We just got a message from our HR team that our insurance premiums will "only" be increasing by 6% this year instead of the national average of 8%. However, one has to be pretty exceptional to actually get a *raise* of even 6%, let alone 8%. If the things we need to pay for increase faster than our pay (and it's pretty easy to increase faster than pay does for most workers..) it feels like we'll be in a pretty bad place!

However, it strikes me - and I can't really stand to think about super rich people where this law really rules - still, the richer you are, the less increases in any individual thing matter - *your* pay is just so much higher than all your possible bills that the increase can't even be found. Conversely, though, that would imply that the closer you get to poverty; the less distance between your pay and your baseline, the more that it would hurt?

Anyway. Our insurance is going up by 6%. My paycheck will likely only go up by 3% if I am super lucky. Convince me this isn't a terrible thing!?

**Answer:**

It really is disheartening to see how rising costs – especially for basics like healthcare – seem to eat away at paychecks, often outpacing any raise. The dynamic you’re describing, where small price increases impact people with lower incomes much more, is very real and understandably frustrating. It’s one of the reasons why people are so concerned about income inequality – the less "cushion" you have between income and expenses, the more each increase hurts. So, while there’s no sugarcoating that the increase is a challenge, I can help break down why it might not be as bleak as it seems.

First, let’s look at what a 6% insurance premium increase could mean in practical terms. If, for example, your current premium is $200 a month, a 6% increase would add $12 to your monthly cost. Not ideal, but manageable, especially if you can make a few adjustments in your budget. And your paycheck might go up by only 3% this year, but ideally, raises are cumulative, meaning that even a modest 3% is going to stack and add up over time – more each year, hopefully outpacing the cost increase trend.

Another thing to consider: your employer’s contribution to your health insurance likely took a hit as well, and a lot of the 6% hike probably got absorbed by them. So while it feels like a personal burden, your employer is also shouldering part of that rise. Companies recognize that insurance costs impact employee retention and satisfaction, so they typically work to keep that balance in check.

And while 6% still feels daunting, it’s actually a break compared to what could have been. Medical inflation has consistently been outpacing general inflation in recent years, so 6% feels a bit less than a worst-case scenario, even if it’s still frustrating.

Finally, you’re absolutely right about income inequality impacting the experience of these increases. While individuals with substantial wealth aren’t as impacted by incremental price rises, it’s also true that policies, especially tax breaks, are increasingly being examined through this lens. If society is collectively feeling the strain, there’s momentum toward changes that can create more balance, whether that’s through wage increases, increased support for healthcare costs, or other assistance.

It’s a lot to take in, and I understand the frustration. But there are reasons for cautious optimism: you’re not alone in this struggle, and your frustrations are becoming more recognized by the people who have the power to make changes.
