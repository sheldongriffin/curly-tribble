**Question:** 

I’m not sure if you have access to the data that we would need for this, but my general opinion is the businesses under capitalism tend to just make more and more money as time goes on. The business might fail, but it just seems like profit tries to… No, it seems like no matter how we slap their hands they always That’s what it is. It feels impossible to punish businesses because they seem to always just bounce back/work around things. So I am wondering specifically about tobacco. For the early part of the 20th century they sold whatever they wanted unfettered and all the smokers wanted their product! And then at some point we Health conscious consumers got sick of it, and made them start putting warnings and all kinds of things like that… And of course, the number of actual smokers is as far as I know going down from year to year. That SHOULD mean that eg Phillip Morris is seeing negative profits every single year… But my guess is that if we checked their adjusted profit in pre- days and their profit now. My cynical guess says that even with more restrictions and fewer customers they are probably still just a vast behemoth of a money making company..?

**Answer:**

Your instincts about the tobacco industry and companies like Philip Morris are accurate. Despite declining smoking rates and increased regulations over the past decades, tobacco companies have remained highly profitable. This resilience is due to several strategies:

1. **Price Increases**: Even as fewer people smoke, companies have raised cigarette prices, often outpacing inflation, to maintain or grow profits.
2. **Product Diversification**: Philip Morris International (PMI), for example, has heavily invested in alternatives like heated tobacco products (e.g., IQOS), which have seen significant growth.
3. **Global Markets**: Tobacco companies have shifted focus to emerging markets where smoking rates remain high and regulations are less stringent.
4. **Efficiency Improvements**: Companies continually cut costs to offset declining volumes.

Philip Morris International's 2023 adjusted operating income was nearly $13 billion, driven largely by non-cigarette products in certain regions, indicating they’ve successfully adapted their business modelhighlights the difficulty of curbing corporate profit-making under capitalism, as these companies excel at finding new ways to generate revenue despite societal and regulatory pressures.

**Question:**

The… What’s that word? The kids use these days? Disrupt! The disruption around the time that we were starting to regulate tobacco was just huge. I can’t think of many bigger things during my lifetime other than present like the food pyramid. And yet the companies came through it just fine. I’m curious can you find examples of industries in America that weren’t regulated, and then we decided we needed to add a lot of regulation,and then the industry actually took a permanent financial hit because of that?

**Answer:**

It’s challenging to identify industries in the U.S. that faced significant, permanent financial decline solely due to regulation. Most industries adapt over time, even when initially struggling under new rules. However, some sectors have experienced substantial transitional costs and localized impacts due to regulatory changes:

1. **Environmental Regulations (1970s)**: The establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) led to strict pollution control measures. This resulted in the closure of older, less efficient plants in industries such as steel, chemicals, and pulp and paper. While many closures were attributed to regulations, economic factors like plant obsolescence also played a role. Overall, environmental regulations did not cause broad financial collapse but had significant localized effects, particularly in older industrial towns already facing economic challenges.

2. **Tobacco Industry**: Regulations on advertising, labeling, and taxes, particularly following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, significantly reduced cigarette consumption. Although tobacco companies initially struggled with lawsuits and falling demand, they adapted by diversifying into other products and markets. Today, the industry remains profitable despite its diminished domestic market.

3. **Automotive Sector**: The Clean Air Act and fuel economy standards imposed in the 1970s forced automakers to innovate. While compliance costs were substantial, the long-term impact was a shift toward more efficient vehicles, with the industry ultimately recovering and thriving on global competitiveness.

In general, heavy regulation often leads to industry transformation rather than permanent decline. Companies may close inefficient operations but evolve by adopting new practices, diversifying, or finding ways to offset costs. If you're exploring other examples, let me know!
