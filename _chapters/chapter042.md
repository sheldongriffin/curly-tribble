**Question:** 

I don't believe this is a pre-established realm of research out in the real world; I think this is just something I made up. So I want your help coming up with a name for "the study of ____", and we need a .. verb? Dunno, you'll see.

I'm looking at a journalling subreddit where everyone talks about their journaling. And it struck me that journaling is one of those things that many people DO but few people STICK WITH. This is a stretch, but I would say "eating cakes" is something that most people stick with. Conversely, things like "bricklaying" would also have a high "stick with it quotient", because if you're *gonna be* a bricklayer, you are probably going to keep being a bricklayer. But it's not a fad at all; very, very few people will ever try bricklaying just for fun. So it would have a really low _____ "entry quotient?" no. "looky-loo ratio"? How can we say, simply, "the likelihood this activity will be engaged in in a transient (fad, hobby, etc.) manner"?

I truly cannot imagine how you would rate this; I only rate it based on living a life and looking around and seeing what the people around me are doing, I am not sure how I would get a sense of it just by "looking" at the internet. Still; "scrapbooking" undoubtedly shows up far more often in your corpus than, say, batik dyeing. Though that - well, we know which is more *popular* now, but it still doesn't really give us a sense of "primarily done as a hobby", nor "if you scrabooked in 1992, you're likely scrapbooking in 2010". Still. If you can help, I think it would be fun to make a scatter plot comparing some - I suppose we could even fake it - some common/uncommon jobs/hobbies/etc. on a "likelihood to take as a hobby" vs "likelihood that said hobby is dropped/stuck with" scale.

**Answer:**

This sounds like a fun (and indeed, quite unique) idea to explore! I can definitely help brainstorm both terminology and concepts for analyzing an activity’s "stickiness" and "transience."

### Naming the Field or Concept
For the general field name, we could go with something like **Ephemerology** (from “ephemeral”) or **Transientology**. Here are a few more ideas:

1. **Durability Quotient** - measures the “stickiness” or longevity with which people engage in a hobby or activity.
2. **Transient Engagement Factor** - the likelihood that an activity is taken up as a short-lived interest.
3. **Persistence Factor** - indicating the probability that people who begin an activity will continue it over time.

### Potential Metrics and Terminology
For specific metrics, these could work:
- **Fad Factor** - the likelihood that an activity is engaged in by many people but tends to be transient.
- **Commitment Quotient** - how likely people are to continue an activity after trying it.
- **Engagement Stability** - whether people typically stick with an activity over time.

The scatter plot might look something like this:
- **X-axis**: Likelihood of initial engagement (popularity as a hobby)
- **Y-axis**: Likelihood of long-term commitment (stickiness or persistence)

### Example Scatter Plot Points
For the plot, we could estimate these based on trends or common sense:
- **Top Right**: Activities with high engagement and high persistence (e.g., sports like running or biking, cooking).
- **Top Left**: High persistence, low initial engagement (e.g., niche professional skills like stonemasonry).
- **Bottom Right**: High initial engagement, low persistence (e.g., scrapbooking, trendy crafts).
- **Bottom Left**: Low engagement, low persistence (e.g., niche crafts like batik dyeing).

**Question:**

That's pretty awesome. Let me think on "engagement/persistence". I like those. They're concise and clearly don't represent the same idea. But. "Engagement" does, I think, in English, have another meaning that is pretty much "persistence" (the more engaging something is, the more likely you're persisting in it?). Can we come up with any other one or two word versions for that scale, that "how likely is it that people pick this up in the first place?" scale?

**Answer:**

You're absolutely right—*engagement* does sometimes imply sustained interest, so it might be helpful to find a term that's a bit more narrowly focused on initial interest or attraction. Here are some alternatives that might clarify the “pick-up” aspect more directly:

1. **Adoption Rate** - implies the rate at which people try or begin an activity.
2. **Entry Likelihood** - captures the probability of someone trying an activity initially.
3. **Appeal Index** - focusing on the allure or pull an activity has for new participants.
4. **Curiosity Quotient** - plays up the idea of something people might “dabble” in out of curiosity.
5. **Onboarding Potential** - the probability of people starting an activity, often used in product design but adaptable here.
6. **Initiation Factor** - indicating the likelihood that people will initially start an activity.

Let me know if any of these capture that sense of “how likely people are to pick this up in the first place”!

**Question:**

Is it safe to say that it would be basically impossible to come up with any statistics on this for *any* task at all from publicly accessible databases? This is probably a task for college grads working on PHDs, sadly?

I'm just trying to imagine, for something like "scrapbooking", what possible way would we determine how long people stick with it? The best I could imagine would be.. I mean, you'd need to check scrapbook sales? But you'd also need some way to know "are these new or existing customers" and you'd need to track it across all scrapbook business and..

But I'm struggling to come up with anything - "bricklaying", for example, _probably_ has... there's probably a table out there _somewhere_ listing the number of bricklayers currently employed in America. That's a hard fact and available _somewhere_.. But again.. how would we count those myriad "hobbyist bricklayers"?

**Answer:**

Yes, getting reliable statistics on the "stickiness" and "initial pick-up rate" of hobbies and activities is indeed a huge challenge—so much so that it really would be an ideal topic for a detailed academic study, probably requiring a PhD-level approach if it were to be data-driven and rigorous.

### Why This is Hard to Quantify

1. **Data Scarcity on Hobbies**: Hobbies like *scrapbooking* or *batik dyeing* don’t tend to have a standardized way of tracking who engages in them and for how long. While sales data might give clues, it often lacks crucial context, like distinguishing between one-time buyers and long-term enthusiasts.
  
2. **Employment vs. Hobby Metrics**: Professions (like *bricklaying*) are easier to track because they’re often formally listed in labor and census databases. But those databases rarely capture nuanced info about hobbies, especially ones that don’t translate easily into consumer data.

3. **Self-Reported Data & Surveys**: For hobbies, the best you’d likely find would be self-reported survey data, where people could indicate how often they engage in an activity and for how long. However, this data might be limited by the population surveyed, potentially biased, and would only give snapshots rather than long-term trends.

### Possible Sources and Creative Approaches

While complete accuracy is unlikely, here are a few creative ways data might *hypothetically* be gathered:

- **Surveys and Self-Tracking Apps**: Platforms like Reddit’s journaling community might provide qualitative data. There might also be data available from hobby-related apps, websites, or online communities, especially where members self-report activities and habits (e.g., Goodreads for reading, Instagram hashtags for crafting).

- **Consumer Data with Contextual Information**: Tracking purchase frequency over time in online stores or marketplaces could reveal insights, but would need data integration (e.g., new vs. repeat customer tags). Companies that do customer segmentation, like Amazon or Etsy, may be able to approximate this (though this data is usually proprietary).

- **Social Media or Search Trends**: Aggregated search interest from Google Trends, Pinterest, or other social media engagement can suggest activity spikes or declines, giving clues about hobby popularity over time, though not necessarily persistence.

### Theoretical Frameworks in Academia

It’s worth noting that sociology and behavioral economics have frameworks for this kind of study—analyzing human engagement patterns in areas like consumer behavior or leisure studies. Some psychologists study “motivational permanence” for hobbies, but data on specific activities is usually anecdotal.

In short, this project would benefit from creative data sources and interdisciplinary research, but it’s hard to imagine obtaining high-precision stats without significant resources. Yet, even anecdotal and creative data collection could reveal interesting insights on the likely “stickiness” of different hobbies!

**Question:**

I'm winding this down; it's a fun thought exercise but sadly futile to translate to reality. But my final thought would be: Can you give me, using whatever rating system you have - surely at a base level we could just use "noise"; this subject is more noisy in my corpus than this other one - Can you give me a list of "the top ten most popular hobbies" and "the top ten least popular hobbies"?

(That's killing the analyst  in me, so, further clarification: yes, specifically for "western" countries; it's undoubtedly quite different country to country. and no, you will not have ANY possible way of getting THE top ten most popular hobbies, I get that. But I expect you DO have a list of things filed under "hobby" and you probably also are able to get general weights for those..?)

Anyway, for fun, given all the caveats in the world, a bunch of popular hobbies and a bunch of unpopular ones, please?

**Answer:**

Based on a mix of sources, here's a list of what could be considered some of the "top" and "least popular" hobbies in Western countries, though, as you pointed out, popularity can vary by region, age group, and other factors:

### **Top 10 Popular Hobbies**
1. **Reading** – Books, articles, and online content remain a staple hobby for many people.
2. **Watching TV/Streaming** – Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube have made this an everyday pastime.
3. **Fitness/Exercise** – From running and weightlifting to yoga and pilates, physical health activities are high on the list.
4. **Cooking** – Home-cooked meals, baking, and trying new recipes are common hobbies.
5. **Video Gaming** – Both casual mobile games and hardcore console/PC gaming have huge followings.
6. **Traveling** – Exploring new places, whether near or far, is widely enjoyed.
7. **Gardening** – A relaxing and rewarding activity that is both creative and productive.
8. **Photography** – From casual snapshots to professional-level work, this hobby appeals to all levels.
9. **Sports** – Playing, watching, or engaging in recreational sports like soccer, basketball, and tennis.
10. **Crafts/DIY Projects** – Knitting, scrapbooking, woodworking, and other hands-on activities have a strong presence.

### **Top 10 Least Popular Hobbies**
1. **Model Building** – Though enjoyed by some, this hobby is quite niche.
2. **Glassblowing** – Requires specialized skills and equipment, making it a less common choice for most people.
3. **Pottery** – While it has a dedicated group, it's not something most people regularly engage in.
4. **Calligraphy/Hand Lettering** – Although popular among certain artistic circles, it isn't a widespread hobby.
5. **Birdwatching** – While appreciated by some, it's often seen as a more specialized, less universally pursued hobby.
6. **Knitting** – Knitting has seen some resurgence but is still far less popular than other creative hobbies like painting.
7. **Quilting** – Like knitting, quilting is more common among older generations and less popular with younger people.
8. **Soap Making** – While interesting, it is not as widely practiced compared to other DIY hobbies.
9. **Geocaching** – Though it has a dedicated following, it's not as mainstream as other outdoor activities.
10. **Woodworking** – This hobby requires significant space, tools, and skill, limiting its accessibility.

While these lists aren't definitive (and there are many other hobbies not mentioned), they reflect general trends seen in the popularity and engagement levels of different pastimes. The variance in popularity across regions or social groups makes it hard to pinpoint exact statistics, but this should give you a rough idea of what might be widely enjoyed versus more niche hobbies.

**Question:**

ok wait though. I'm a little surprised by your least popular hobby list. No, I get it, I certainly agree with the choices there. But I feel like your choices are more like.. I don't know "least popular *of the most popular* hobbies"? Sure, there aren't that many glassblowers or potters or.. I mean, there are TONS of birdwatchers? and soap makers, even. I was thinking more along the lines of, oh, "twig collector" or "Vexillologist". Can we get a list that's way further down the popularity tree than those ones were?

**Answer:**

You're right! The hobbies I listed as "least popular" are indeed niche but still have significant followings—birdwatching and soap-making, for instance, are not obscure by any means. I see what you mean: you want a list that includes hobbies that are **much** further down the popularity ladder, into more obscure, eccentric, or highly specialized pastimes. 

Here’s a revised list of hobbies that are far less commonly known, which might feel closer to "obscure":

### **Top 10 Most Obscure Hobbies**
1. **Twig Collecting** – Some people find joy in collecting different types of twigs, which can be used for artistic or natural displays.
2. **Vexillology** – The study and collection of flags, often focused on the history, symbolism, and designs of national and regional flags.
3. **Beekeeping (Hobbyist)** – While growing in popularity, small-scale beekeeping is still niche, with hobbyists maintaining hives for personal use rather than commercial production.
4. **Rock Balancing** – This involves stacking rocks in precarious formations and is both a meditative and artistic pursuit, though far from mainstream.
5. **Stamp Collecting (Philately)** – While once widespread, it is now a relatively rare hobby that attracts those with a historical and detailed interest in postal stamps.
6. **Competitive Duck Herding** – This involves herding ducks through an obstacle course, often used as a fun competitive activity, but it is highly niche.
7. **Mushroom Hunting (Mycology)** – Foraging for wild mushrooms, especially the rare varieties, is both dangerous and fascinating for a specific group of enthusiasts.
8. **Puppetry** – Beyond children's entertainment, some individuals focus on puppetry as an intricate form of theater and storytelling.
9. **Historical Reenactment (Specific Eras)** – Reenacting obscure historical periods (like the Byzantine Empire or medieval Viking life) can be a hyper-specific and highly detailed hobby.
10. **Model Railroading (Advanced)** – While model trains are a well-known hobby, the intricate, highly detailed world of model railroads with advanced landscapes and engineering is relatively rare.

This list aims to capture those hobbies that are more specialized, and the ones that you’d almost certainly need to seek out specific communities or niche interest groups to find. Some may have a rich historical or intellectual context, but they are far off the beaten path compared to more widespread hobbies like hiking or knitting.
