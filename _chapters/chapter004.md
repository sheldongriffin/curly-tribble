**Question:** With Roku having become a company that seems to WANT to keep screwing with their customer’s privacy, I am left in search of.. Well, a whole new TV! Since apparently in the modern world we want smart tvs, now “our television’s privacy practices” are an actual thing to worry about (oh: and the OS is built in so we can’t swap it out for a better one…).

Anyway, please talk a bit about the main players in the tv *OS* world for me, and if anything of them are somehow alrekniwned for being better with privacy, let me know.

(Note: You could include a section on “dumb tvs” or “external” : we can actually use, say, a Raspberry Pi to connect to a tv and provide most of our streaming needs.. but! Even with an external OS that we control, oops, Roku tvs, for example, now won’t even *turn on* without forcing you to make an account! So even with an external box, with a smart tv, you are still somewhat stuck with the tv OS)

**Answer:** You're absolutely right—modern "smart TVs" come with integrated operating systems that often prioritize data collection and advertising over user privacy. Let's break this down into the major players in the TV OS world, their privacy concerns, and alternative strategies like "dumb TVs" and external streaming solutions.

## **Main TV OS Platforms**
### **1. Roku TV**
- **Privacy Concerns**: Roku is notorious for aggressive data collection, including tracking what you watch across apps and even on HDMI-connected devices. Their terms and conditions often require creating an account, and many settings require manual opt-out.
- **Customization**: Minimal—you’re locked into their OS.
- **Privacy Measures**: You can turn off ACR (Automatic Content Recognition) and limit tracking, but this is buried in settings and doesn’t address all data collection.

### **2. Google TV / Android TV**
- **Privacy Concerns**: As with most Google products, Google TV integrates heavily with the Google ecosystem, collecting data for targeted ads. It tracks viewing habits, app usage, and even voice commands if using a Google Assistant-enabled remote.
- **Customization**: Decent, since it allows sideloading apps, but you can’t remove Google’s tracking infrastructure.
- **Privacy Measures**: Opt out of personalized ads and disable microphone access, but the core data-sharing policies remain.

### **3. Amazon Fire TV**
- **Privacy Concerns**: Fire TV is closely tied to Amazon's ecosystem and is designed to push Amazon services. It tracks viewing habits and app usage and has been criticized for its invasive advertising practices.
- **Customization**: Minimal, as you’re locked into Amazon’s OS.
- **Privacy Measures**: You can disable interest-based ads and limit tracking, but you’re still subject to Amazon’s overarching data policies.

### **4. Samsung Tizen**
- **Privacy Concerns**: Samsung collects data through ACR and voice commands if you use their smart assistants. While they claim to anonymize data, their privacy policy allows for broad use of collected data.
- **Customization**: Low—Tizen is proprietary.
- **Privacy Measures**: ACR and tracking can be disabled, but Samsung still collects metadata.

### **5. LG webOS**
- **Privacy Concerns**: LG is another offender in the data collection game, using ACR to track viewing habits and voice commands via its Magic Remote.
- **Customization**: Minimal; you’re locked into webOS.
- **Privacy Measures**: ACR can be disabled, but data collection for analytics and ads persists unless explicitly opted out.

### **6. Vizio SmartCast**
- **Privacy Concerns**: Vizio has been fined in the past for collecting data on users without their knowledge. Their SmartCast system is heavily reliant on data collection for monetization.
- **Customization**: Limited; SmartCast lacks flexibility.
- **Privacy Measures**: ACR and data sharing can be disabled in settings.

## **Alternatives: Dumb TVs and External Solutions**
If you value privacy above all, a "dumb TV" paired with an external streaming device is the way to go. While rare, there are still options:

### **Dumb TVs**
- **Pros**: No built-in OS means no forced data collection, no tracking, and no account requirements.
- **Cons**: Limited availability; most are smaller or marketed for commercial use.
- **Examples**:
  - Certain commercial displays from brands like NEC or Sony.
  - Non-smart HDTVs from smaller brands (e.g., Sceptre or Insignia).

### **External Streaming Devices**
These allow you to bypass TV OS tracking and manage your privacy better:
- **Raspberry Pi**: You can set up an open-source OS like Kodi or Plex, giving you full control over data and streaming.
- **Apple TV**: While Apple tracks usage within its ecosystem, it’s known for better privacy practices than competitors like Google or Amazon.
- **NVIDIA Shield**: Android-based but allows more customization and can integrate with VPNs for better privacy.
- **Gaming Consoles**: PlayStation or Xbox can be used as streaming devices and have fewer invasive privacy practices than dedicated TV OS platforms.

### **Caveats**
Even with an external device, "smart" TVs often require interaction with their OS for basic functions like turning on or changing inputs. For example, Roku TVs require an account to activate—even if you never use their smart features.

## **Recommendations**
- **If Privacy Is Critical**: Go for a dumb TV paired with a Raspberry Pi or Apple TV. These setups minimize data collection and give you control.
- **For Better OS Privacy**: Among smart TVs, LG webOS and Samsung Tizen are slightly better than Roku, Google TV, or Fire TV when privacy settings are fully adjusted.
- **Always Check Settings**: Disable ACR, turn off voice assistants, and opt out of personalized ads where possible.

In summary, the combination of a dumb TV and an external device is the best solution for privacy-conscious users. However, if you're stuck with a smart TV, be prepared to dig deep into settings to mitigate its intrusive practices.
