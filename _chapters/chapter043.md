**Question:** 

macro vs micro vs ____?

Which words do we use when talking about "big picture" vs "hyper specific"

**Answer:**

When discussing concepts on a spectrum from "big picture" to "hyper specific," the terms typically used are:

1. **Macro**: Refers to the "big picture" or broader perspective.
2. **Micro**: Refers to the detailed or more specific level.
3. **Nano**: Sometimes used to describe something extremely specific or granular, even more so than "micro."

So, the progression is often **macro** (big picture), **micro** (detailed), and **nano** (hyper specific).
