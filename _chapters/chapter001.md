**Question:** What is the purpose of life?

**Answer:** The purpose of life is a profound question that has captivated humanity for centuries. Philosophers, scientists, and spiritual leaders have all offered interpretations:

1. From a **biological standpoint**, life exists to propagate itself through reproduction and adaptation.
2. **Philosophical perspectives** vary widely. Existentialists might argue that life has no inherent meaning, and itâ€™s up to individuals to create their own purpose.
3. **Religious beliefs** often attribute purpose to divine will or spiritual fulfillment.

In practical terms, many find purpose in relationships, achievements, and personal growth. Ultimately, it might be more about the journey than a definitive answer.
