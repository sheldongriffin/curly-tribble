**Question:** I like to come up with what I call "bumper sticker phrases": quick bursts of words that get across a concept easily. One example would be - I actually can't think of the original but the new disgusting conservative shock jock version is "Your Bodies, My Choice". "slogan" is a close synonym, except slogans kinda *require* an.. object, no? They don't stand on their own, a slogan is for something, whereas - another example would be "An Apple A Day Keeps The Doctor Away".  Definitely not a "slogan", fits on a bumper sticker, and catchily gets its point across.

So!
1. What might we call these?
2. Please come up with a few on both sides of this issue for me. I've been looking around lately and noticing: "Rich people get curves, poor people get squares" (in architecture, or cars, or design or..). It's a weird thing that doesn't need to be true (necessarily: there IS a non-zero cost to making "things" "interestingly": it's always going to be cheaper to mass produce simpler things and more expensive to make unique things. That's almost Physics, not just Capitalism; I don't believe there's ANY financial system in the universe where more complicated things could be as cheap as simple things). NONETHELESS! It means our (not rich people's) houses are all squares and angles, no curves. It means our chairs and tables and bureaus from from Ikea, not Neiman Marcus (oh: but that's significant because Ikea = straight lines and Neiman = occonasional real hard wood, curve, etc.).

Anyway. I want some short phrases that mean, basically, "muahah I'm rich, you're not, I get curves, you don't!" (My original DOES "contain" that: "Rich people get curves, poor people get squares" - but that's.. *descriptive*? not.. it's a statement of "This is how it IS", not "This is how it SHOULD BE". Anyway. The entitled rich person's attitude is obviously gross but I still want to play with it. One the other side, let's come up with some phrases that say "Rich people get cuves, poor people get squares, *and that's totally uncool*".

**Answer:** 1. **What might we call these?**
   These kinds of quick, impactful phrases that express a concept without needing a full explanation might be called **"soundbite phrases"** or **"quip statements."** They encapsulate a larger idea or critique in just a few words, much like a slogan but often more self-contained, without necessarily promoting something specific. Another term could be **"provocative taglines"** or even **"social commentary bumper stickers."**

2. **On the rich side ("I get curves, you get squares"):**
   - **"Curves for the elite, squares for the rest."**
   - **"We make the world round; you make the world flat."**
   - **"Luxury bends, your reality is boxed."**
   - **"Curves cost, squares are free."**
   - **"We sit on curves, you sit on angles."**
   - **"Rich homes have curves; poor homes have walls."**
   - **"A curve’s a privilege; a square’s a sentence."**

3. **On the poor side ("Rich people get curves, poor people get squares, and that's totally uncool"):**
   - **"Why are the rich getting curves while the rest of us get stuck in boxes?"**
   - **"Curves should be for everyone, not just the elite."**
   - **"The world shouldn’t be square when we all deserve curves."**
   - **"Curves aren’t just for the 1%. They’re for us all."**
   - **"Why do the rich get to live in luxury while we’re boxed in?"**
   - **"We’re not all meant to live in square boxes."**
   - **"Why should the rich get curves while the rest of us get flat?"**

These phrases reflect both sides: the entitlement of the rich and the critique from those on the other side, challenging the inequality in how design and luxury are distributed.
