**Question:** 

Are you able to call out any art installations (the kind where they *make things*, not paintings/photography etc.) whose primary "goal" was auditory but with a strong second level of visual?

I'm looking for a speficic one, and am unlikely to find it, but I should probably give more specifics. The thing I'm vaguely remembering was an installation of... shapes. stalactites? muppets? (taht seems weird there but I'm just getting Fraggle Rock vibes) things like sea anenenomes? (that all sounds organic; I'm trying to describe shapes, not actuality). There was a lot of "stuff" - pinks and greens and tubes and cones and... They, many of them, were making various noises, like, say, wind chimes would, or a flat tire, or..

Anyway. Interesting art installations of the 20th and 21st century that included noise and visual, and didn't really involve electronics or phogotraphy or paintings..?

**Answer:**

It sounds like you're thinking of an immersive, multi-sensory art installation where sound and visuals blend together in a unique, organic, and almost whimsical way. Given your description, a few notable examples come to mind that blend auditory and visual elements, particularly ones that don't rely on electronics, photography, or traditional painting.

### 1. **David Byrne’s *Playing the Building* (2005)**
   This installation by musician and artist David Byrne might align with the sound-focused aspect you're describing. Though it didn't feature the specific "shapes" you mentioned, it involved a repurposed building where every part of the structure—pipes, windows, railings—was turned into a musical instrument. Visitors could play the building by interacting with the physical structure, producing a variety of sounds, from wind-chime-like tones to resonant vibrations. The building itself took on an organic, sculptural quality, but the installation focused on the auditory experience with a strong visual presence as people saw the apparatuses and systems used to create the sound.

### 2. **Carsten Höller’s *Test Site* (2006)**
   While more known for his large-scale installations, Höller’s works often involve engaging sensory experiences that play on the visual and auditory senses. One example is *Test Site*, where visitors would encounter giant slides and tubes, which could create both sounds and visual experiences as people moved through them. Though it doesn’t match the specific shape description, Höller’s work often involves organic forms and interactive elements that might be in the vein of what you're remembering.

### 3. **Nicolas Schöffer's *Cybernetic Sculpture* (1956 onwards)**
   A pioneering figure in cybernetic art, Schöffer created sculptures that were often both visually dynamic and capable of responding to sound. These works combined elements of movement, light, and sound, but they often didn’t use electronics in a traditional sense. His sculptures—often combining tubes, cones, and fluid forms—could react to environmental factors, producing noises and sounds that resonated with the physical form in space.

### 4. **Zimoun's Sound Sculptures (2000s – present)**
   Zimoun's work, particularly his *sound sculptures* (e.g., *Zimoun 188 Prepared DC-Motors*, 2011), often uses simple mechanical systems to create a variety of sounds, such as wind-chime-like noise or rhythmic mechanical sounds. These sculptures frequently consist of everyday materials—boxes, tubes, wires—that interact in ways that create a satisfying auditory experience, often accompanied by dynamic, organic-looking structures. While Zimoun does use motors, his work doesn’t rely on traditional electronics or complex technology, making it closer to the tactile, almost organic quality you're recalling.

### 5. **James Turrell’s *Skyspaces* (1970s onwards)**
   While primarily known for his light installations, James Turrell's *Skyspaces* combine sound and visual elements in unique ways. These installations often include audio components, such as ambient soundscapes or natural sounds like wind and rain. The sculptural, architectural forms of the installations create a powerful visual experience, but the sound aspect is a secondary, yet still integral, part of the environment.

### 6. **Louise Bourgeois' *Maman* (1999)**
   While Bourgeois’ *Maman* (the giant spider sculpture) is not explicitly an auditory installation, many of her sculptures incorporate textures and forms that encourage multiple sensory interpretations. In some cases, her sculptures were paired with sound art pieces, emphasizing a more visceral, organic experience that could evoke similar feelings of "shapes" and "creatures" making sounds.

### 7. **Pauline Oliveros’ *Deep Listening* (1989)**
   A conceptual piece more focused on auditory perception, Oliveros' work is centered around the experience of sound. While it might not match the exact aesthetic you're thinking of, the work challenges listeners to engage with sound in an immersive, physical way, often creating environments where sounds are produced by organic interactions, much like the wind-chime or "flat tire" noise types you mentioned.

If these examples don't quite capture the installation you're remembering, it might help if you can pinpoint any details related to the environment, location, or artist. But from your description, these installations should be at least somewhat related in concept and materials.
