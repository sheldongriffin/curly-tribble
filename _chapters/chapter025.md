**Question:** 

So: On the one hand, modern progressives generally consider "consumerism" to be a bad thing. On the other hand, there is some real truth to the fact that if you ARE going to buy things, there is some value to be found in well crafted items that meet your standards. I'm often astounded at the difference in.. cheaper, mass produced things are more plain and boring, while more expensive things have the space for quality materials *and* interesting design. This is, to some extent, reductionist, but there's some actual truth to the bumper sticker style statement: "Poor people get 90 degree angles - rich people get curves".

So: In a world where buying things in the first place is generally considered "bad", how do we make an argument for not only buying things, but buying *nice things*?

**Answer:**

This question strikes at the tension between valuing material goods and critiquing consumerism, and it’s a nuanced argument. Here’s how you might frame the discussion:

### 1. **Rejecting Mindless Consumerism ≠ Rejecting All Consumption**
The critique of consumerism isn’t inherently about rejecting ownership or enjoyment of material things—it’s about resisting overconsumption, planned obsolescence, and the disposability mindset. In this context, advocating for *quality over quantity* aligns with progressive values because:

   - **Longevity Reduces Waste:** A well-crafted, durable item requires fewer replacements, which can reduce the environmental and social cost of production.
   - **Sustainability Through Design:** Investing in items that are sustainably sourced and made by companies that treat workers ethically supports broader systemic change.
   - **Mindful Ownership:** Choosing fewer, better things aligns with minimalism, a philosophy often intertwined with critiques of consumerism.

### 2. **The Value of Aesthetics and Craftsmanship**
Good design and craftsmanship aren’t mere indulgences; they reflect creativity, skill, and an investment in culture. “Nice things” often mean:

   - **A Connection to the Maker:** Artisan or high-quality products can support craftspeople or small businesses, which is preferable to supporting mass production.
   - **An Emotional Bond:** Well-designed items often inspire care and appreciation, reducing the likelihood they’ll be discarded.
   - **Cultural Enrichment:** Unique designs and materials can reflect heritage, art, and identity, making them part of cultural preservation.

### 3. **Economic and Social Arguments**
   - **Challenging the Cheap-Mass-Produced Paradigm:** Mass production often exploits labor and natural resources. Investing in well-made items can shift demand away from exploitative practices.
   - **Affirming Equity in Design:** The observation that “poor people get 90-degree angles” reflects systemic inequality. Arguing for better design accessibility doesn’t mean rejecting nice things—it means advocating for everyone’s right to them.
   - **Empowering Through Choice:** Encouraging people to buy fewer, better things can make them feel more empowered and intentional about their consumption, rather than trapped in a cycle of “cheap, replaceable, dull.”

### 4. **Reframing “Buying Nice Things” as a Moral Act**
   - **Choose Makers Over Corporations:** Support small, local businesses or ethically responsible brands.
   - **Prioritize Functionality and Sustainability:** Nice things aren’t about luxury but about practicality and reduced impact.
   - **Second-Hand and Vintage:** High-quality items retain value over time, making second-hand markets an accessible way to enjoy craftsmanship.

### 5. **A Practical Bumper Sticker**  
“Buy less, buy well.”  
This reframes the argument: It’s not about consumerism; it’s about respecting resources, supporting ethical production, and finding joy in thoughtful choices.

By advocating for careful consumption, you’re not championing “consumerism”—you’re pushing for a more intentional relationship with material goods.
