**Question:** 

How are bra sizes calculated/what's it based on?
What are the.. with every kind of calculation, there are bound to be edge cases where things don't quite line up. What are common issues with the way that bras are created?

Semi-corrolary: It doesn't feel like "bra sizes" adequately can fill in for "please describe the various shapes, volumes, and surface areas of breasts in a specific way"; I would expect there can be two breasts that fit the same size bra, but vary widely in presentation. But - like the anecdote about 200 different words for snow - who would need language for categorizing breasts? only people that come to mind are plastic surgeons. _Maybe_ gynecologists? Anyway! Are there any, feactiously, "competing standards organizations" trying to bring sanity to the question of breast nomenclatures? And what terms/phrases/buckets/sorting mechanisms have they come up with?

**Answer:**

Bra sizes are based on two primary measurements: the band size and the cup size. The band size is the circumference of the torso just under the breasts, and the cup size represents the difference between the bust measurement (around the fullest part of the breasts) and the band measurement. Generally, the larger the difference between these measurements, the larger the cup size.

### Common Calculation Challenges
There are indeed edge cases and a lot of fit issues. Here are a few examples:

1. **Cup and Band Proportions**: The cup size is relative to the band size, meaning a 32D is not the same volume as a 38D. As band sizes increase, the cup volume also scales, making it tough to standardize.
  
2. **Breast Shape Variations**: Breast tissue placement, density, and distribution affect fit. For example, “shallow” or “full on top” breasts may not align with standard cup shapes. Two people might have the same measurements but very different fit needs based on shape, projection, and spacing.

3. **Symmetry and Distribution**: Most women have asymmetrical breasts, with one side typically larger than the other. This asymmetry means that bras, which are almost universally symmetrical, might fit unevenly.

4. **Industry Standardization Gaps**: Brands use different sizing charts, and a “D” in one brand may fit like a “C” or “E” in another. This lack of standardization across countries and brands is a major source of confusion.

5. **Cup Overflow and Underflow**: For people with more projected or pendulous breast shapes, cups may gap or cut in due to the one-dimensional measurement that doesn’t fully represent the breast’s three-dimensional shape.

### Attempts to Categorize Breast Shapes and Types
Medical and lingerie professionals have actually tried to classify breast shapes to improve fit and understanding. While there isn’t a single “organization” per se, various professionals, particularly in the lingerie and surgical fields, use these categories:

1. **Breast Shape**: Common shapes include teardrop, round, asymmetrical, slender, and bell-shaped. These categories help understand how breast fullness and positioning impact fit.

2. **Projection and Fullness**: Breasts can be “full on top” (more fullness above the nipple line), “full on bottom,” or even throughout. This impacts how certain bra styles (like balconettes vs. plunge bras) fit.

3. **Spacing**: Breasts can be widely spaced, closely spaced, or center-full, which changes the ideal cup construction and wire width.

4. **Density and Firmness**: Different tissue densities impact projection and sagging, influencing bra styles or types like padded vs. unlined.

5. **Plastic Surgery Terminology**: In plastic surgery, terms like “projection,” “volume,” and “width” are more common, with focus on anatomical landmarks to help define the size and shape more scientifically. 

While there isn't a "universal breast categorization council," the lingerie and medical fields have developed these classifications to create better-fitting bras and support medical procedures. Online bra fitting communities and fit-focused brands often incorporate these terms and categorization systems to educate consumers and tailor product recommendations. 

In the end, the bra sizing system is a pretty limited shorthand for what’s actually a complex set of characteristics – and creating a truly “universal” system would probably require a drastic shift in how bras are designed, fitted, and sold.
