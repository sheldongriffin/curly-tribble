**Question:** 

My general opinion is that nobody could ever convince me of this stuff; crystals, rare stones, "mhz", concoctions, whatever.. western "spirituality" feels based in.. hmm. why do I rank it even lower than religion on the "yeah, makes sense!" spectrum? *maybe* because there are more... "tokens"? Catholocism says there's a spirit out there who does X. But it doesn't really point to "rub this stone for luck" or "burn this incense" (in your house - i know they do during some ceremonies). Anyway, so maybe it's just the people pointing to objects (or sounds) and claiming they have some magical significance - this obviously inert stone in my hand can help my GI tract?!? Someone fights believability more than "this invisible guy in the sky" can.. Anyway! I do have an actual question. Let's take two items from that: 
1. The YouTube video that brought me here, titled "432 Hz - The Sound of the Tibetan Flute , Attracting Positive Energy, Remove Accumulated Stress"
2. Let's say, "crystals" ("the healing power of crystals!")

Can you talk to me, please, about ANY even vaguely believable research that shows that either of these things - sounds at 432hz? specifically flutes at 432hz? I don't know! and crystals healing us - any reasearch at all or even, I suppose, "(some of) we believe that crystals have healing properties because of this long tradition of X"?

I feel kinda like Mulder: I *want to believe*! (... but it's just so unbelievable)

**Answer:**

Your skepticism is quite reasonable, and you're not alone in feeling that practices like "healing crystals" or "432 Hz" sound frequencies seem to stretch credibility. Let’s break it down:

---

### 1. **432 Hz and Healing Sounds**  

The idea that 432 Hz is a "special" frequency tied to healing or positive energy is part of a broader pseudoscientific trend in sound therapy. Proponents argue that 432 Hz has a special resonance with nature or the human body because it's mathematically harmonious, supposedly aligning with natural frequencies in the universe.

**The Claims:**
- It's said to be more "in tune" with the vibration of the universe than the modern standard tuning of 440 Hz.
- Listening to music at 432 Hz is claimed to reduce stress, improve focus, or promote spiritual well-being.

**The Research:**
- **Scientific Basis:** There is no rigorous scientific evidence showing that 432 Hz is inherently better or more healing than other frequencies. Studies on sound therapy often rely on the *placebo effect* or are too anecdotal to form reliable conclusions.
- **Psychological Effects:** Some studies suggest that certain types of music or frequencies can promote relaxation, but this is not specific to 432 Hz. What helps is typically related to personal preference, cultural associations, or the calming effects of music in general.
- **Misconceptions in Physics:** Claims about 432 Hz aligning with "universal frequencies" often involve misinterpretations of physics, such as the Schumann resonance (Earth's electromagnetic field, which is around 7.83 Hz). There's no physical basis for linking these phenomena.

So, while sound and music can indeed be therapeutic, the mystical focus on 432 Hz as a unique healing frequency lacks credible evidence. Any benefits people experience likely come from general relaxation or personal belief.

---

### 2. **The Healing Power of Crystals**

The belief in crystal healing dates back thousands of years and spans many cultures, from ancient Egypt to traditional Chinese medicine. Proponents say crystals can balance energies, heal ailments, or even affect mood.

**The Claims:**
- Crystals are thought to channel or store energy.
- Different types (e.g., amethyst for calmness, rose quartz for love) are believed to align with certain chakras or energies.

**The Research:**
- **Placebo Effect:** Studies on crystal healing have shown that any benefits people report are likely due to the placebo effect. For example:
  - A 2001 study presented participants with crystals and fake crystals. Both groups reported feeling effects, suggesting that belief, not the crystals themselves, was responsible.
- **Material Properties:** While crystals have fascinating physical and optical properties (like quartz in watches), these don't translate into biological effects on the body.
- **Historical Context:** Crystals were used in ancient medicine because of their beauty, rarity, and symbolic power. This aligns with human tendencies to imbue objects with meaning, but it doesn’t demonstrate actual healing properties.

---

### Why It Feels Hard to Believe  

You pointed out something important: *tokens*. Western "spirituality," especially in its modern, commercialized forms, often relies on physical objects (crystals, sound bowls, incense, etc.) as focal points. This tangibility can make the claims feel even more implausible than belief in an unseen deity or spirit.

Religion, at least in its doctrinal forms, often anchors itself in metaphysical or moral frameworks, whereas modern spiritual trends tend to promise direct, tangible benefits ("this crystal will *heal* you"). When these benefits don't have a plausible mechanism, it feels far-fetched.

---

### Why People Believe  

Even if there's no scientific backing, why do people still gravitate toward these ideas?

1. **Placebo Effect:** Belief itself can trigger real physiological responses, like reduced stress or improved mood. People often associate these changes with the object or practice, rather than the belief.
   
2. **Cultural and Symbolic Value:** Crystals and sound therapies can have deep cultural or personal meanings. This symbolic resonance can make practices feel effective.

3. **Need for Control:** When faced with uncertainties (health issues, stress, etc.), people often turn to practices that provide a sense of agency—even if the science is weak.

4. **Sensory Appeal:** Crystals are beautiful and tactile; sound baths are soothing and immersive. These qualities make them naturally appealing, regardless of whether they "work" in a clinical sense.

---

### Final Thought: Mulder’s Dilemma  

You *want to believe*, and that’s not irrational. It's human to seek patterns, connections, and meaning, even when evidence is lacking. While the direct claims about 432 Hz and crystals lack scientific backing, the practices associated with them—like listening to calming music or meditating with crystals in hand—can still offer psychological or emotional benefits.

Perhaps the best way to "engage" with these things is as art or ritual rather than science. They may not heal your GI tract or remove stress on their own, but they can still contribute to an environment where healing and relaxation are more likely.

**Question:**

Is there *any*... So, "Chinese medicine", for example, has things like acupuncture, or like the cool walls-covered-with-drawers-filled-with-various-herbs. India, I think, is where "chakra" comes from, and I believe I've seen Indian-style (as opposed to Chinese) diagrams of various mystical pieces of the human body.

That's a big net: "*all* Eastern maybe-pseudo-science", but maybe less so: snake oil, *actual snake oil* where the phrase came from.. as far as I know, we kinda stopped selling that at all in America, 200 or so years ago. They probably also weren't selling it in, say, the year 800 (I mean, I'm sure they had fake cures; they just would have been *different* at the time). But things like "chakras" and "hot/cold/yin/yang" and "Chinese herbalism" and "acpuncture" have been going on reasonably unchanged for *millenia*, no? So whether there's actually "anything there" or not, some of these things have to at least be considerred more seriously.

So we assume that this has happened - that skeptical people have said "This acupuncture stuff is obviously BS! There's nothing special about this specific nerve!" *but also* have had to objectively look at whether it "works" overall.

The stuff we talked about above? Crystals, frequencies, it seems like they're pretty soundly agreed to be junk science (please, people, use them if you want to. half of being health is believing we can be healthy! i don't want to besmirch your beliefs (/hobby :P)). Acupuncture has, I think, a lot more.. There probably has been more than one study that's shown a  statistically significant "success rate". But of course the next step, when you see that something seems to work, even though you cannot believe in its modality.. I mean, the next step is, "ok, it seems to work, but WHY", and I'm pretty sure that we probably have found no actual reason for acupuncture, turmeric, gingko biloba, Ayurveda..

Anyway, please talk about the meeting point of western skepticism with the "well we've been doing it for 2000 freaking years, dudes!" of the eastern medical traditions?

**Answer:**

You’re raising a great point, and it's a fascinating intersection between centuries-old traditions and modern skepticism. Practices like acupuncture, herbal medicine, and Ayurveda have been used for thousands of years, and their endurance over millennia certainly warrants serious consideration. In contrast, many contemporary wellness trends like crystal healing and the 432 Hz frequency are much newer and have been discredited more easily. So, let’s explore the long-standing traditions you’re asking about, their place in modern science, and how skepticism interacts with these practices.

### The 2000-Year-Old Argument: Tradition vs. Skepticism

**Eastern practices like acupuncture, herbalism, and Ayurveda** are often deeply rooted in cultural, spiritual, and holistic understandings of health. These practices aren’t just about "treating symptoms" in the same way modern Western medicine tends to; they aim to balance the body, mind, and spirit in a way that aligns with philosophical ideas like balance (yin/yang in Chinese medicine) or energy flow (chi/qi). The longevity of these practices suggests they’ve been meaningful for people in these cultures, and *some* of their methods have even been examined more thoroughly in the modern context.

However, this long history doesn't mean these practices are automatically effective in the scientific sense. For example:

1. **Acupuncture:**
   - **The Claim:** Acupuncture is said to balance the flow of *qi* (energy) along specific pathways (meridians) in the body. It’s been used for pain relief, stress management, and various other ailments.
   - **The Science:** Acupuncture has been studied extensively, and some studies show it can be effective for certain conditions, particularly pain (e.g., chronic back pain, osteoarthritis). However, many of these studies face challenges such as the placebo effect or methodological flaws. Some research suggests that acupuncture works through mechanisms like the activation of endorphins, or through the brain’s own pain-regulating pathways, rather than any mystical explanation of energy flow.
     - **So why does it seem to work?** While acupuncture’s theoretical basis (meridians, energy flow) doesn’t hold up scientifically, the practice may still have therapeutic benefits, particularly when combined with a placebo effect or relaxation response. Studies show that acupuncture's benefits often align with those of other treatments that promote relaxation or body awareness.

2. **Chinese Herbalism:**
   - **The Claim:** Chinese herbalism involves using various plant-based substances to treat everything from common colds to chronic diseases, based on a deep understanding of how different herbs interact with the body.
   - **The Science:** Chinese herbs have garnered some research attention, with certain compounds showing promise in treating specific conditions. For instance, **Ginseng** (a common herb in traditional Chinese medicine) has been researched for its potential to improve energy and reduce fatigue, with some studies showing moderate benefits. Similarly, **turmeric** (which is used in both Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine) has been found to have anti-inflammatory properties.
     - **Challenges:** While there’s evidence for some herbal treatments, much of Chinese herbalism’s lore involves complex combinations of herbs whose interactions haven’t been fully studied. Also, issues with quality control, sourcing, and standardization complicate the ability to measure the true effects of these herbs scientifically.

3. **Ayurveda:**
   - **The Claim:** Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine from India, based on balancing the body’s energies (doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha) through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and mindfulness.
   - **The Science:** Ayurveda's holistic approach (combining diet, lifestyle, and herbs) has been scrutinized in modern clinical settings. Some Ayurvedic treatments, like **turmeric** or **ashwagandha**, have shown efficacy in treating inflammation or stress in certain studies. However, Ayurveda is vast and involves highly individualized treatments, which makes it hard to generalize scientifically.
     - **Challenges:** Many of the traditional treatments in Ayurveda are unproven in modern clinical trials, and some can even be harmful if not properly regulated (for instance, **heavy metals** in some Ayurvedic products have caused poisoning).

### Why Skeptics Should Take It Seriously

You’re absolutely right: skepticism is necessary, but it’s also important to approach these ancient practices with nuance. Here are a few reasons why it's worth taking these practices seriously:

1. **Longstanding Tradition:** As you mentioned, these practices have been around for *thousands* of years. If a particular approach didn't work at all, it likely wouldn’t have persisted. The fact that acupuncture, for example, has been around for over 2,000 years in various forms (and is still practiced globally) indicates that many people have found it useful—whether through placebo, cultural, or perhaps physiological effects we don’t yet fully understand.

2. **Holistic Perspective:** Unlike Western medicine, which often targets specific symptoms or diseases, traditional Eastern medicine often takes a holistic approach. This broader perspective can be valuable for addressing lifestyle-related issues (stress, sleep, digestion) that Western medicine sometimes overlooks. Acupuncture, meditation, or herbal treatments may complement traditional treatments in ways that are psychologically or physiologically beneficial.

3. **Exploration of "Why It Works":** As you pointed out, the next step is always “Why does this work if we don’t understand the mechanism?” In some cases, mechanisms may eventually be understood. For instance, acupuncture might not align with ancient concepts of energy, but it might be affecting the body’s nervous system in ways we’re still learning to quantify. The placebo effect, while often dismissed, is a real psychological phenomenon, and understanding how it works can help us understand how these treatments have their benefits.

4. **Modern Research and Integration:** Increasingly, modern medical research is investigating these practices in controlled, clinical environments. For instance, acupuncture is now often used in conjunction with conventional medicine, especially for pain management and stress-related conditions, even if the exact mechanism is not well understood. This integration doesn't mean that traditional Eastern medicine is right about everything, but it shows that the outcomes of these practices may have a basis in physiological or psychological effects, even if those effects are different from the original explanations.

### The Battle of Skepticism and Tradition

The core tension between modern Western skepticism and traditional Eastern practices boils down to the difference in how knowledge is acquired:

- **Western skepticism** demands measurable, replicable evidence before accepting any claim. If something doesn’t have a clear, scientifically-verifiable mechanism, it's often dismissed as pseudoscience.
- **Eastern traditions**, on the other hand, often operate in a different framework, one that’s more experiential, qualitative, and holistic. Knowledge in these systems is based on generations of observation, personal experience, and cultural transmission, which may not lend itself to controlled trials.

### So, What’s the Conclusion?

You’re absolutely right that practices like acupuncture or herbalism, even without a clear "why," have persisted for millennia, and that’s worth respecting. While scientific research has yet to explain everything about them, some of the treatments show measurable benefits, even if the mechanisms are still unclear. This doesn’t mean that every traditional practice is scientifically valid, but it does suggest that there’s often *something* to explore.

For people who are open to it, these practices can be part of a broader wellness routine—whether for their potential therapeutic effects, placebo benefits, or as part of a culturally meaningful experience.

Ultimately, it’s about balancing skepticism with openness to the possibility that ancient practices may hold insights that we’re still in the process of understanding through modern science.

**Question:**

Is this the placebo effect, or a similar one? It strikes me that some people do actually improve *because they believe they should* (the acupuncture, the herbs, the crystals, whatever, they have reason to think that they should work, and so, like with pain, they do work, but it's really because your brain has convinced yourself that..)
Anyway, the distinction I'm trying to dig at is, it seems to me that, say, Chinese herbal medicine might "work" for my Taiwanese wife, because she was raised in a culture that was steeped in the idea that it *does* work, whereas, possibly, with me, it might not work at all because I think it's really just a disgusting tea with no healing properties.

This is, I guess, the placebo effect more or less, and I supposet he only thing I'm adding to it is a distionction between, say, a *cultural placebo* effect like Chinese poeple believing in acupuncture, vs, the more standard "placebo" of just a western person taking a sugar pill that they *believe* is actually medcine..

Anyway. English have any help for me making that distionction or am I just stuck with "placebo"?

**Answer:**

You're definitely onto something interesting here, and your distinction between a "cultural placebo" effect and the more standard placebo effect is thoughtful. While "placebo" is the term most commonly used to describe this phenomenon, there are nuances that you’re describing, and language can help make those distinctions clearer.

### Standard Placebo vs. Cultural Placebo

The **placebo effect** in its typical form refers to a person experiencing real improvements in their condition because they believe they are receiving a treatment, even if that treatment is inert (e.g., a sugar pill). The key here is that the individual expects a positive outcome, which triggers physiological or psychological responses that lead to actual improvement.

Now, you're suggesting a variant of this that hinges on **cultural context**, where someone’s belief in a treatment’s effectiveness is not just based on personal expectation but also on deeply held cultural values, traditions, and societal norms. This might make the belief even stronger or more ingrained, which could, in turn, make the effect more pronounced or more specific to certain groups of people.

### What You’re Describing: The "Cultural Placebo"

The **"cultural placebo"** you’re describing could be thought of as a more specific and collective form of the placebo effect, where the belief in the treatment is supported and reinforced by the surrounding culture. This belief is embedded in shared history, traditions, and even familial or societal expectations, making the person’s conviction in the treatment stronger.

In your example with your wife and Chinese herbal medicine, she may have grown up with a cultural framework where these treatments are commonly accepted and expected to work. That cultural context gives her a strong sense of efficacy when she takes the herbs. For you, as someone raised in a different cultural context (with skepticism or indifference toward those same treatments), the herbs might not "work" as effectively because the cultural belief in their power isn’t there.

This dynamic is similar to what happens with **cultural conditioning**, where people from different cultural backgrounds may respond very differently to the same treatment because of different beliefs about its efficacy.

### Is There a Term for This?

There isn’t a universally agreed-upon term in English specifically for "cultural placebo" in the same way that "placebo effect" is recognized. However, there are a few related concepts that can help capture the essence of what you’re describing:

1. **Cultural Conditioning** – This refers to the way cultural beliefs and values shape people’s responses and behaviors, which can include their expectations of health treatments.
   
2. **Placebo of Tradition** – This term could be used to describe the belief that something works because it’s deeply rooted in tradition, even if modern science hasn’t shown it to be effective. It highlights the idea that a cultural or historical belief in a treatment's power can have a placebo-like effect.

3. **Expectancy Bias** – This is a broader term that encompasses the idea that what people expect to happen influences how they experience outcomes. In a cultural context, this could mean that someone’s expectation of a treatment’s success is heavily influenced by cultural beliefs about that treatment.

4. **Cultural Relativism in Health** – This idea involves understanding that health practices and beliefs vary across cultures. It’s not so much a “placebo” effect but a recognition that what works (or is believed to work) varies depending on cultural context, and these differences are not necessarily due to ignorance or superstition but are often deeply intertwined with cultural identity and social learning.

### Why It Might Be Stronger or Different

1. **Shared Belief Strength**: A belief shared by a group is often stronger than an individual’s personal belief alone. If everyone around you believes in acupuncture or herbal medicine, it reinforces the belief in the treatment's efficacy.
   
2. **Social Validation**: The support of family, community, or culture provides additional layers of belief validation. For your wife, her family might use Chinese herbal medicine regularly, so the treatment is part of an ongoing, normalized process that’s not questioned.

3. **Cultural Significance**: In some cultures, treatments like acupuncture or herbal remedies are not just about physical health—they are deeply entwined with cultural identity, spirituality, and history. This makes the placebo effect tied to a sense of belonging, continuity, and tradition.

### Is It Different From the Placebo Effect?

In essence, yes, your distinction makes sense. **Cultural placebo** could be seen as a type of placebo effect, but it’s specifically rooted in the collective beliefs of a community or culture rather than just an individual’s belief. It’s not just about *expecting* a treatment to work because you’ve heard it will—it’s about being part of a cultural narrative that includes this belief as a foundational piece.

While it still operates in much the same way as the placebo effect (expectation and belief leading to a physiological or psychological response), the cultural aspect adds a layer of social and historical weight that makes it potentially more powerful or ingrained. It’s less likely to be easily dismissed by the individual since the belief is shared, validated, and reinforced by those around them.

### Conclusion

To sum up, what you're describing is a culturally-infused form of the placebo effect—where the belief in a treatment's efficacy is not just an individual expectation but a broader cultural expectation. While there’s not a widely recognized term for this exact phenomenon in mainstream psychology, you could use terms like **cultural placebo**, **placebo of tradition**, or **cultural conditioning** to capture the idea. It's a form of the placebo effect, but with the added layer of cultural context that amplifies or enhances its effects.
