**Question:** What “kinds” does nausea do doctors talk about? As a lead person I have a few different categories in my head, but I’m not really sure that they make any kind of actual medical sense.

One kind that is half of the problem that I’m facing these days is when I’m not feeling nauseous at all and then I look at some food that I’m supposed to eat for dinner and I see some fat on it or some too much sauce or whatever and that makes me feel a little nauseous just anticipating.

There’s another kind commonly found when your body needs to expel your excess alcohol, a much deeper nausea that starts down in your stomach and turns into vomit. 

But there’s another kind that… Sometimes you can be coughing too much? I don’t know that I would call it nausea but you end up throwing up anyway, but it’s not so much any anticipatory thing nor is it something that starts in your stomach trying to expel anything… 

And of course there’s the nausea that comes if I do manage to choke down that food that’s making me nauseous just looking at it? But it actually hits my stomach. A lot of the times my stomach is gonna feel uncomfortable… 

Anyway, tell me what you can about different types of nausea/vomiting in as much as that even vaguely a thing, please.

**Answer:** Doctors and medical researchers do recognize different "types" or causes of nausea and vomiting, though they typically categorize them based on **underlying mechanisms**, **triggers**, or **associated conditions**. What you're describing reflects distinct ways nausea presents and progresses, and your observations align with several medically recognized patterns. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Anticipatory Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** This occurs when the sight, smell, or thought of food (or other triggers) causes a feeling of nausea. It's often associated with a learned response (e.g., associating certain foods with past negative experiences) or heightened sensitivity to sensory input.  
   - **Examples:** 
     - Seeing food with too much fat or sauce (as you described).  
     - Common in people undergoing chemotherapy who feel nauseous before treatment even starts.  
   - **Mechanism:** Thought to involve the brain's **vomiting center** in the medulla, influenced by memory and the autonomic nervous system.  

---

### 2. **Visceral or Gastrointestinal Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Nausea that originates from irritation or dysfunction within the digestive system itself, often accompanied by a deep discomfort in the stomach. This type commonly leads to vomiting as the body tries to "expel" irritants.  
   - **Examples:**
     - Alcohol-induced nausea from stomach irritation.  
     - Overeating or food poisoning.  
   - **Mechanism:** Signals from the gut (via the vagus nerve) inform the brain of digestive distress or toxins, activating nausea and vomiting reflexes.  

---

### 3. **Reflex or Cough-Related Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Nausea or vomiting triggered by excessive coughing, gagging, or stimulation of the throat (pharyngeal reflex). This isn’t true "stomach nausea" but instead reflects stimulation of the vomiting reflex from mechanical irritation.  
   - **Examples:** 
     - Persistent coughing leading to vomiting.  
     - Gagging while brushing your teeth.  
   - **Mechanism:** Overactivation of the gag reflex, involving the brainstem and pharynx, rather than the digestive system.  

---

### 4. **Postprandial (After Eating) Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Nausea that arises after eating due to stomach sensitivity, fullness, or improper digestion. This could overlap with **functional dyspepsia** (chronic indigestion) or conditions like **gastroparesis** (delayed stomach emptying).  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Eating food that previously seemed unappealing, leading to nausea or discomfort once it hits your stomach.  
   - **Mechanism:** The stomach struggles with processing or moving food, triggering distress signals.  

---

### 5. **Motion-Sickness or Vestibular Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Caused by a disconnect between sensory signals related to motion (eyes, inner ear, and proprioception). It feels like a more "head-driven" nausea compared to visceral nausea.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Car sickness, seasickness, or nausea from rapid movements.  
   - **Mechanism:** The vestibular system (inner ear) sends conflicting messages to the brain, which perceives potential "toxins" and triggers nausea.  

---

### 6. **Psychogenic or Emotional Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Nausea driven by anxiety, stress, or emotional distress. This overlaps with anticipatory nausea but arises more from emotional states than sensory triggers.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Feeling nauseous before giving a speech or during a stressful situation.  
   - **Mechanism:** Stress activates the autonomic nervous system, including signals to the vomiting center in the brain.  

---

### 7. **Metabolic or Chemical Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Nausea due to imbalances or toxins in the body, not directly related to digestion.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Nausea from medications, pregnancy (morning sickness), or systemic illnesses.  
     - Alcohol withdrawal.  
   - **Mechanism:** Chemical signals (e.g., from hormones, drugs, or toxins) stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brainstem, leading to nausea.  

---

### 8. **Chronic or Functional Nausea**  
   - **What it is:** Persistent nausea without a clear organic cause, often associated with conditions like **functional dyspepsia** or **cyclic vomiting syndrome**.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Nausea that doesn’t neatly fit into a pattern but persists for weeks or months.  
   - **Mechanism:** Poorly understood but involves hypersensitivity of the gut-brain connection.

### How Your Experiences Fit:
- **"Looking at food and feeling nauseous":** Closely aligns with *anticipatory nausea*, involving sensory aversion and brain-driven responses.  
- **"Alcohol-induced nausea":** A classic case of *visceral nausea* from stomach irritation and toxin buildup.  
- **"Coughing leading to vomiting":** A form of *reflex nausea* tied to mechanical triggers rather than stomach distress.  
- **"Nausea after eating that food anyway":** Likely *postprandial nausea*, possibly indicating stomach sensitivity or delayed digestion.

If nausea is significantly affecting your ability to eat or function, it may be worth discussing these patterns with a healthcare provider to explore conditions like **gastroparesis**, **functional dyspepsia**, or potential autonomic nervous system issues.
