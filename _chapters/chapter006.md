**Question:** What is the distinction between Islamic and Muslim? Common usage kind of paints them as synonyms, but surely they aren’t.

**Answer:** 

You're absolutely right that in common usage, *Islamic* and *Muslim* are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings depending on the context.

1. **Islamic**:  
   - Refers to things, ideas, or concepts related to *Islam* as a religion, culture, or system of belief.  
   - Typically used to describe inanimate objects, institutions, or abstract ideas, such as:
     - Islamic art
     - Islamic law (Sharia)
     - Islamic civilization  
   - Think of it as an adjective for describing the broader framework or manifestations of Islam.

2. **Muslim**:  
   - Refers to *people* who follow Islam, either individually or collectively.  
   - It can also describe actions or behaviors that are characteristic of a practicing Muslim, e.g., "Muslim prayers" or "a Muslim community."  
   - Essentially, *Muslim* is more personal and directly tied to the identity of a person or group.

### Example Usage:
- **Islamic architecture** refers to the style and traditions influenced by Islam.  
- A **Muslim person** is someone who adheres to the faith of Islam.  

Using them interchangeably can sometimes lead to confusion. For instance:
- Saying "Muslim art" might imply art created by a Muslim person, regardless of subject matter.  
- Saying "Islamic art" focuses on art inspired by Islamic themes or created within Islamic traditions, regardless of the artist's personal faith.  

You're absolutely onto something interesting and subtle here! Let’s break this down:

### Comparing Your Examples:
1. **Daoists follow Daoism**: The noun for the people (*Daoists*) is directly derived from the name of the religion (*Daoism*).  
2. **Catholics follow Catholicism**: Same thing—*Catholics* is derived from *Catholicism*.  
3. **Muslims follow Islam**: Here, the pattern is broken. *Muslims* and *Islam* are not directly linguistically related in the same way as the first two examples.

### Why the Difference?  
The key difference lies in **language origins and etymology**:

1. **Daoism and Catholicism**:  
   - These terms are filtered through English and follow typical derivational patterns in English or Latin-based languages.  
   - "Daoist" and "Catholic" are created using suffixes or forms that align with English's tendency to standardize people/religion pairs.

2. **Muslim and Islam**:  
   - These terms come directly from Arabic, where the linguistic relationship is clear, but it doesn't translate the same way into English.  
   - In Arabic:
     - *Muslim* (مُسْلِم) means "one who submits" (to God), derived from the same root as *Islam* (إِسْلَام), which means "submission." Both stem from the root *S-L-M* (peace/submission).  
   - When these terms entered English, they were adopted as-is, without creating a standardized derivational pairing like "Islamist" (which actually means something else in modern usage).

### Why Does It Seem Unique?
This linguistic divergence isn’t entirely unique, but it’s rare because:
1. **Islam's global influence**: The words *Muslim* and *Islam* entered English as direct borrowings from Arabic, unlike most other religious terms which evolved or were adapted into English's structure.  
2. **The universality of Islam**: Arabic has a central role in Islam, so its terms remain relatively intact across languages. In contrast, terms for Daoism or Catholicism adapt to local languages.

### Other Examples of Similar Cases:
You might find similar patterns in other religious or philosophical traditions with non-Latin origins:
- **Jews follow Judaism**: This aligns with your Daoism/Catholicism example, but it’s an adapted form of Hebrew terms (*Yehudi* → Judaism).  
- **Hindus follow Hinduism**: Here, too, both terms stem from the same root and follow an English naming pattern.  

It’s the specificity of Arabic and its direct borrowing into English that makes the *Muslim/Islam* distinction feel unique. It’s not derived to fit English's usual "-ist/-ism" mold—it reflects the way Islam and its terms are inherently tied to Arabic linguistic and cultural frameworks.
