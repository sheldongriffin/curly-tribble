**Question:** 

Elvis or Johny Cash (or both?) : Which are famous for something about a jail?

**Answer:**

Both Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash are famous for associations with jails, but in very different ways:

1. **Elvis Presley** is famously associated with the song *"Jailhouse Rock"*. Released in 1957, it was both a hit single and the title song of a movie he starred in. The song's upbeat rock-and-roll style and Elvis's iconic dance moves in the movie made it one of his most famous works. The song is playful and fun, imagining a party-like atmosphere in jail.

2. **Johnny Cash**, on the other hand, is famous for his *"Live at Folsom Prison"* (1968) album. Cash performed live at Folsom State Prison, bringing his raw, authentic style to an audience of inmates. His performance there, including songs like *"Folsom Prison Blues"*, which features the famous line "I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die," cemented his reputation as an artist who connected with the marginalized and incarcerated.

So:  
- **Elvis** is famous for a fictional, fun depiction of jail.  
- **Johnny Cash** is famous for a real, raw connection to prison life and the people in it.
