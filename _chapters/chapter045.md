**Question:** 

Please explain the following items to my beginner music student, in one or two sentences each, at most, using language a sixth grader can understand:

Musical Alphabet
Staff
Bar Line
Measure
Double Bar Line
Treble Clef Sign
Bass Clef Sign

Then also please explain to me: She has two different "kinds"? of - whatever the thing is with the five lines - sometimes it starts with something vaguely like an ampersand, and others it starts with.. a spiral? And apparently the letters are all different on the spiral one?

**Answer:**

Here are simple explanations for your student:

- **Musical Alphabet**: The musical alphabet is just the letters A to G, used to name notes in music.
- **Staff**: The staff is the set of five lines where we write music notes.
- **Bar Line**: A bar line is a vertical line on the staff that separates the music into smaller sections.
- **Measure**: A measure is the space between two bar lines, and it holds a group of notes or rests.
- **Double Bar Line**: A double bar line shows the end of a section or the whole piece of music.
- **Treble Clef Sign**: The treble clef sign looks like a fancy "G" and tells us which notes go on which lines for higher sounds.
- **Bass Clef Sign**: The bass clef sign looks like a backward "C" with two dots, and it shows the notes for lower sounds.

As for your question: The "thing with five lines" is the **staff**. When it starts with something like an ampersand (üéº), that's the **treble clef**, which is for higher notes. When it starts with a spiral or backward "C" (ùÑ¢), that's the **bass clef**, which is for lower notes. The letters (note names) are in different places for each clef, which is why it might seem like they're different on the two staffs.
