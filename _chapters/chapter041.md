**Question:** 

“Avoidance” is definitely one of the top 10 coping strategies, but it doesn’t feel like one that the American psychological Association is really interested in helping you _improve_ and build upon. I think usually avoidance is something you’re trying to _work your way out of_?

But most of the other ways of dealing with things are a lot more complicated and difficult than avoidances, and I feel like it could be useful as a stopgap measure. Maybe even an end-state for some people. 

Are there any types of therapy like DBT and CBT that actually help you improve your avoidance skills?

**Answer:**

You're right that avoidance is often viewed as a problematic coping mechanism in psychology, particularly when it becomes a chronic or pervasive way of dealing with stress or emotions. Therapies like CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) generally aim to reduce avoidance because it can prevent people from addressing the underlying causes of distress or achieving meaningful goals. However, avoidance can have its uses in certain contexts, and some therapeutic approaches acknowledge this.

### 1. **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**
ACT encourages people to accept their emotions and thoughts without judgment while committing to actions aligned with their values. While ACT doesn't focus on *improving* avoidance, it can help you understand when avoidance is serving a short-term protective purpose versus when it’s preventing you from living a fulfilling life. It encourages strategic, short-term avoidance in situations where immediate action might cause harm or overwhelm, but it balances this with long-term values-based actions.

### 2. **Prolonged Exposure Therapy**
While this therapy is often used to treat PTSD and phobias by reducing avoidance through gradual exposure, it also acknowledges that avoidance has served as a survival strategy. Therapists help clients recognize when avoidance has been protective and work to replace harmful avoidance with more intentional coping strategies.

### 3. **Short-Term Avoidance and Distress Tolerance in DBT**
DBT has a concept called *distress tolerance skills,* which are meant to help people cope with crises without making things worse. Techniques like distraction, self-soothing, or temporarily avoiding a situation are forms of what might be called "structured avoidance." These are used as stopgap measures until a person is ready or able to address the root problem. DBT explicitly teaches how to use these skills effectively and without guilt.

### 4. **Problem-Solving Therapy**
This therapy focuses on teaching skills to address problems directly, but it also incorporates ways to temporarily set problems aside when dealing with them isn't feasible. For example, it might include strategies to prioritize which problems to address and when, allowing for thoughtful avoidance of less urgent issues.

### Can avoidance be a long-term strategy?
The question of whether avoidance can ever be a long-term coping strategy is complex. For some people, particularly those with chronic conditions or traumatic histories, avoidance might be reframed as **selective disengagement**—a conscious choice to step back from harmful or overwhelming situations. In this sense, avoidance becomes less about fear or incapacity and more about preserving emotional resources.

If you're interested in *developing* avoidance as a skill, you might focus on areas like:

- **Prioritizing Avoidance**: Learning when to avoid and when not to (e.g., avoidance in high-conflict relationships or situations that aren’t aligned with your goals).
- **Mindful Disengagement**: Using mindfulness to notice and choose avoidance in a way that feels deliberate and empowering.
- **Crisis Management**: Leaning into therapies that teach stopgap coping, like DBT's distress tolerance techniques.

Avoidance isn’t always the enemy—it’s often a natural part of survival. The key is using it as a tool, rather than a reflex.
