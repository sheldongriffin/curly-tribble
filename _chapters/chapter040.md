**Question:** 

I'm looking for "short, powerful narratives". Like *exceptionally short*. "Sub-short-story" short. There's at least one "internet thing to do" along these lines "six word memoirs/stories". I didn't find any lists of five word or 12 word, but I'm not stuck specifically with *six* words. Nonetheless, the most famous of which is:

"For sale: baby shoes, never worn."

That one's a whole life and death and so much pain, all in just six words. (ooh. this one is equally devastating: "Born a twin; Graduated only child.") The other examples I've seen online are shallow in comparison;
"Sorry soldier, shoes sold in pairs." - not TERRIBLE but.. The soldier has one leg. That's it?

Anyway, not sure how you'd rate it -I'm happy enough if you just steal from a "hardest hitting 6 word story" list - but can you come up with any other really tiny but nonetheless hard hitting examples?

**Answer:**

Absolutely! Here are some compact, powerful stories that carry weight and emotion, designed to evoke a reaction with as few words as possible. I mixed in some of my own with well-loved examples to keep them impactful.

---

1. "Left in August, love letters unread."
  
2. "He said forever; she believed him."

3. "Forgotten anniversary. She brought flowers."

4. "He kissed her forehead, whispered goodbye."

5. "Grandpa's voice, alive in the recordings."

6. "Found the ring after he left."

7. "Left the stove on. Home wasn’t."

8. "Three missed calls. I answered too late."

9. "Childhood home, empty rooms echo now."

10. "First car: new. Last car: donated."

11. "She asked for cake. Got ashes."

12. "We laughed, then he closed his eyes."

13. "Cried myself to sleep in his bed."

14. "Her suitcase by the door, forever."

15. "Graduated alone. Parents cheered from above."

16. "Every photo of her has him."

17. "Lost her once; losing her again."

18. "Finally read it: ‘Dear John.’ Too late."

19. "New job. Old dog. Same leash."

20. "Forgot to say goodbye, she’s gone."

Each of these is designed to hit on themes of love, loss, regret, and nostalgia—so much emotion in so few words. Which ones resonate most with you?
