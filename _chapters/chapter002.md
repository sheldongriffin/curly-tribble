**Question:** Why do people procrastinate?

**Answer:** Procrastination is a complex behavior rooted in psychology, motivation, and emotional regulation:

1. **Fear of failure**: People often delay tasks they perceive as challenging to avoid potential failure.
2. **Lack of clarity**: Unclear goals can lead to postponement as the next steps seem overwhelming.
3. **Instant gratification**: The lure of short-term rewards (like scrolling social media) can overshadow long-term benefits.
4. **Perfectionism**: The desire to do something perfectly can paralyze action entirely.

Breaking tasks into manageable steps and fostering self-discipline are common strategies to overcome procrastination.
